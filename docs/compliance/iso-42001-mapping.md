# ISO/IEC 42001 -- Dark Factory Governance Mapping

> ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS). International standard specifying requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an AI management system.

## Overview

ISO/IEC 42001 follows the Annex SL high-level structure (clauses 4-10) common to all ISO management system standards. This document maps each clause to the Dark Factory Governance Platform's artifacts, processes, and controls, demonstrating how the platform supports organizations seeking ISO/IEC 42001 certification.

| 5. Leadership | `CODEOWNERS`, escalation chains | Approval authority, role boundaries, accountability |
| 6. Planning | `.governance/plans/` | Mandatory plan-first workflow, risk treatment plans |
| 7. Support | Documentation, personas, prompts | Context management, review prompts, shared perspectives |
| 8. Operation | Panel execution, structured emissions | Multi-persona review, deterministic policy evaluation |
| 9. Performance Evaluation | Run manifests, canary calibration | Audit records, detection accuracy measurement, metrics |

| 6.2 AI objectives | `GOALS.md` tracks project objectives; plans document implementation intent | `GOALS.md`, `.governance/plans/` |
| 6.3 Planning of changes | Mandatory plan-first workflow -- every implementation requires a plan before code | `.governance/plans/`, plan template |

## Clause 7 -- Support

*Resources, competence, awareness, communication, documented information.*

| Requirement | Governance Control | Artifact |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| 7.1 Resources | Context management tiers (Tier 0-3) optimize resource allocation; parallel Coder dispatch scales execution | Context management architecture |
| 7.2 Competence | 24 specialized review perspectives with full evaluation criteria; six agentic personas with domain expertise | `governance/prompts/reviews/`, `governance/prompts/shared-perspectives.md` |
| 7.3 Awareness | CLAUDE.md and instructions.md distributed via symlinks to all consuming repos; copilot-instructions.md for IDE integration | `config.yaml` symlink configuration |
| 7.4 Communication | Agent protocol with typed messages (ASSIGN, STATUS, RESULT, FEEDBACK, ESCALATE, APPROVE, BLOCK, CANCEL) | `governance/prompts/agent-protocol.md` |
| 7.5 Documented information | Three artifact types (Cognitive, Enforcement, Audit) with defined mutability; schemas enforce structure | Artifact type system, JSON schemas |

## Clause 8 -- Operation

*Operational planning and control, AI risk assessment, AI risk treatment.*

| Requirement | Governance Control | Artifact |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| 8.1 Operational planning | Agentic startup sequence (5 phases) automates operational workflow; governance pipeline enforced on every change | `governance/prompts/startup.md` |
| 8.2 AI risk assessment | Six mandatory panel types on every PR: security-review, threat-modeling, cost-analysis, documentation-review, data-governance-review, code-review | Policy profile `required_panels` |
| 8.3 AI risk treatment | Policy engine produces deterministic decisions; `execution_context` records full provenance (model version, hash, provider, version date) | Policy engine, `execution_context` |
| 8.4 AI system impact assessment | `data_classification` tracks emission sensitivity; `compliance_score` measures policy adherence | `data_classification`, `compliance_score` |

## Clause 9 -- Performance Evaluation

*Monitoring, measurement, analysis, evaluation, internal audit, management review.*

| AI system documentation | A.6.2 | `documentation-review` panel; mandatory plans; structured emissions |
| Record management | A.6.3 | Immutable run manifests; append-only audit artifacts |
| AI system risk management | A.7.2 | Multi-profile policy engine; `risk_level` and `ai_act_risk_tier` classification |

## Annex B -- Implementation Guidance

For organizations using Dark Factory to support ISO/IEC 42001 certification:

1. **Scope definition** -- Configure `project.yaml` with appropriate policy profile and governance settings.
2. **Risk assessment** -- Ensure all six mandatory panels execute on every change; review `ai_act_risk_tier` classifications.
3. **Evidence collection** -- Structured emissions with `execution_trace` provide audit evidence; run manifests serve as immutable records.
4. **Gap analysis** -- Compare panel emissions against Annex A controls to identify coverage gaps.
5. **Continuous monitoring** -- Enable canary calibration to detect panel accuracy drift over time.
