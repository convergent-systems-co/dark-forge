# Documentation

Navigation hub for all Dark Factory Governance Platform documentation.

## Quick Start

New to the platform? Start here:

1. [Developer Guide](onboarding/developer-guide.md) — Quick-start onboarding
2. [Governance Model](architecture/governance-model.md) — Understand the five governance layers
3. [Repository Setup](configuration/repository-setup.md) — Configure your project

## Architecture

Deep-dive into platform design and internals.

### Agentic Architecture

The agentic loop uses a 4-agent prompt-chained pipeline. Start it with `/startup` in your AI tool.

| Persona | Pattern | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| [DevOps Engineer](../governance/personas/agentic/devops-engineer.md) | Routing | Session entry, pre-flight, triage, issue routing |
| [Code Manager](../governance/personas/agentic/code-manager.md) | Orchestrator-Workers | Intent validation, panel selection, review coordination, merge |
| [Coder](../governance/personas/agentic/coder.md) | Worker | Implementation, tests, documentation |
| [Tester](../governance/personas/agentic/tester.md) | Evaluator-Optimizer | Independent evaluation, test coverage gate, structured feedback |
