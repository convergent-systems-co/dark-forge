## 2. Terminology Corrections

Issue #220 originally stated: *"The Governance workflow transitions to a prompt injection loop."*

**"Prompt injection" is a security vulnerability (OWASP #1 for LLM Applications), not a workflow pattern.** The correct terms:

| Issue Term | Correct Term | Definition | Source |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| "Prompt injection loop" | **Prompt chaining** | Sequential subtasks where output feeds the next | Anthropic, Prompt Engineering Guide |
| "Prompt injection loop" | **Ralph Wiggum Loop** | External validation loop with stateless resampling | Geoffrey Huntley |
| "Prompt injection loop" | **Evaluator-Optimizer** | Generate → evaluate → iterate until criteria met | Anthropic Cookbook |

**Resolution:** Term corrected to "prompt chaining loop" in the issue body.

---

## 3. Anthropic Agent Patterns Applied

Anthropic identifies five workflow patterns. Mapping to the governance pipeline:

| Pattern | Definition | Governance Equivalent | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Prompt Chaining** | Sequential subtasks, output feeds next | Workflow phases (FEAT-1 → FEAT-2 → ...) | Already used |
| **Routing** | Classify input, route to specialist | Policy profile selection (default, fin_pii_high, etc.) | Already used |
| **Parallelization (Voting)** | Same task, multiple prompts, aggregate | Panels with persona perspectives | **Key pattern for consolidation** |
| **Parallelization (Sectioning)** | Independent subtasks in parallel | Running code-review + security-review simultaneously | Should adopt |
| **Orchestrator-Workers** | Central LLM delegates dynamically | Code Manager → Coder delegation | Already used |
| **Evaluator-Optimizer** | Generate → evaluate → loop | PR review cycles | Already used |

Anthropic explicitly endorses the governance use case:

> *"You can use voting when reviewing a piece of code for vulnerabilities, where several different prompts review and flag the code if they find a problem."* — Building Effective Agents

The consolidated review prompts implement this Voting pattern directly.

---

## 4. Consolidation vs. Status Quo Analysis

### Counter-arguments evaluated

| Claim | Assessment | Verdict |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Single source of truth prevents drift** | Valid risk, but `shared-perspectives.md` addresses it. Locality of Behaviour (Carson Gross) favors inline definitions. | Consolidate with shared-perspectives.md |
| **Audit traceability from emissions** | NIST/SOC2/PCI-DSS require decision traceability, not file-path traceability. `findings[].persona` uses string labels, not file paths. | Not blocked by consolidation |
| **Consuming repo composability** | Theoretical — no mechanism exists for custom panel compositions. 19 personas appear in only 1 panel. | Not exercised; consolidation doesn't prevent future composability |
| **Phase 5 multi-agent justifies current architecture** | Contradicted by Anthropic ("add complexity only when it demonstrably improves outcomes") and Google DeepMind (multi-agent degrades sequential performance by 39-70%). | Premature abstraction |
| **Context cost solved by JIT loading** | Partially true, but 30-42 tool calls per PR review consumes 60-84% of the tool call budget. | Self-contained prompts eliminate tool call overhead |
| **File count is misleading** | Valid for frequently-changed files, but governance artifacts change as a unit, not individually. | Consolidated files match change patterns |
| **Per-persona emission fidelity** | **Strongest counter-argument.** Per-persona findings enable weighted aggregation and effectiveness tracking. | Constraint on consolidation: must preserve per-persona emission structure |

### Decision matrix

| Aspect | Status Quo (60 files) | Consolidation (19 prompts) | Winner |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Context efficiency | 30-42 tool calls/PR | 6 file reads/PR | **Consolidation** |
| Duplication risk | None (single source) | Managed via shared-perspectives.md | **Consolidation** |
| Audit traceability | File path → emission | Section header → emission | **Equivalent** |
| Phase 5 readiness | Persona fragments | Full agent system prompts | **Consolidation** |
| Anthropic alignment | Contradicts "start simple" | Matches Voting pattern | **Consolidation** |
| Ralph Loop compatibility | Requires file-chasing | Self-contained per iteration | **Consolidation** |
| Schema compliance | Preserved | Preserved | **Equivalent** |

---

## 5. MCP Skills vs. Self-Contained Prompts

An external review report (2026-02-25) proposed converting high-reuse personas into MCP Skills registered as tools like `skill_security_auditor`, with panels becoming orchestrator+sub-prompt trees distributed via the awesome-dach-copilot MCP server.

### Research verdict: Self-contained prompts are superior for this use case.

| Criterion | MCP Skills / Tools | Self-Contained Prompts | Research Winner |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Token efficiency | 400-500 tokens/tool definition + discovery overhead | Zero tool overhead | **Self-contained** |
| Accuracy at scale | Degrades past 20 tools (Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI) | No tool-count dependency | **Self-contained** |
| Frontier model performance | Decomposition shows diminishing/negative returns (arXiv 2025) | Single-prompt Voting matches Anthropic recommendation | **Self-contained** |
| Multi-agent overhead | 3.2x less efficient per token (Google DeepMind) | Single-agent baseline efficiency | **Self-contained** |
| Sequential task degradation | 39-70% degradation (Google DeepMind) | No degradation (single context) | **Self-contained** |
| Error propagation | 17.2x amplification with independent agents | Single context, no propagation | **Self-contained** |
| Audit traceability | Unchanged (`findings[].persona`) | Unchanged (`findings[].persona`) | **Equivalent** |
| Phase 5 readiness | Must be re-architected | Prompts become agent system prompts directly | **Self-contained** |

### Why MCP Skills don't fit

1. **Skills ≠ Tools.** Anthropic defines Skills as "the recipe" — markdown instructions an agent reads and follows. Skills don't execute anything. Self-contained review prompts already ARE skills in Anthropic's terminology. Registering them as MCP tools adds infrastructure without benefit.

2. **Tool count budget exceeded.** 15-20 persona-skills + Claude Code's existing tools = 23-28 total tools. Anthropic's Opus 4 drops to 49% accuracy with large tool libraries (recovers to only 74% with Tool Search). Microsoft Research recommends "expose as few tools as possible."

3. **No infrastructure exists.** The ai-submodule deliberately removed MCP server code (commit b636ebd) with rationale "MCP configs belong in consuming repos." Zero skill files, zero awesome-dach-copilot references exist in the codebase.

4. **Two-repo coordination cost.** Splitting cognitive (dach-copilot) and enforcement (ai-submodule) layers creates version drift risk. Breaking changes to `panel-output.schema.json` require coordinated releases across repos.

### When MCP Skills would make sense

If governance personas need to be invoked by **external agents or third-party MCP clients** without filesystem access to the governance repo. This is a legitimate Phase 5 requirement but is not the current operating model.

---

## 6. Multi-Agent Performance Research

### Google DeepMind / MIT: "Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems" (Dec 2025)

180 agent configurations tested across multiple benchmarks. Key findings:

| Metric | Single Agent | Centralized Multi-Agent | Ratio |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| Tasks per 1,000 tokens | 67 | 21 | **3.2x single-agent advantage** |
| Sequential task performance | Baseline | -39% to -70% degradation | Multi-agent hurts |
| Error amplification | Baseline | 17.2x | Independent agents amplify errors |

**The "45% Rule":** If a single agent solves more than 45% of a task correctly, multi-agent systems are usually not worth it. Current single-prompt panels already exceed this threshold.

**Implication for governance:** Panel reviews are sequential reasoning tasks — evaluating code against criteria, checking for vulnerabilities, assessing performance. This is precisely the category where multi-agent showed the worst degradation.

### Anthropic's guidance

> *"Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short."*

> *"Consider adding complexity only when it demonstrably improves outcomes."*

---

## 7. Tool Count Scaling Research

### Documented thresholds

| Source | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **OpenAI** | Recommends "fewer than 20 functions at any one time" |
| **Anthropic** | Opus 4: 49% accuracy with large tool library → 74% with Tool Search mitigation |
| **Anthropic** | Opus 4.5: 79.5% → 88.1% with Tool Search (still 12% failure) |
| **Microsoft Research** | Tool name collisions and semantic overlap degrade accuracy; "expose as few tools as possible" |
| **Stacklok (independent)** | Tool Search achieved only 34% accuracy with 2,792 tools (contradicts Anthropic's optimistic benchmarks) |

### Token overhead

At ~400-500 tokens per tool definition, 25 tools consume 10,000-12,500 tokens before any conversation begins. In a governance session with 80% context hard-stop, this is a meaningful fraction of available context.

### Implication

Adding 15-20 persona-skills on top of Claude Code's existing tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, etc.) pushes total tool count past the documented 20-tool degradation threshold.

---

## 8. Sub-Prompt Decomposition Research

### Frontier model findings

arXiv (Feb 2025) — "Decomposed Prompting Does Not Fix Knowledge Gaps":
- Smaller models (≤70B) benefit from decomposition
- **Frontier models show diminishing or negative returns**
- Consistency on multi-hop benchmarks reached only 59.7%

### Error propagation risk

ScienceDirect (2025): *"Errors in early-stage subtasks can propagate downstream, compounding inaccuracies and complicating root-cause analysis."*

### Implication for orchestrator → sub-prompt pattern

The proposed orchestrator → 5 sub-prompts → consolidation pattern creates:
- 7 files per panel instead of 1
- 5 inter-step boundaries where errors can propagate
- Loss of shared evaluation context (each sub-prompt runs independently)
- No benefit on frontier models where the governance pipeline operates

---

## 9. Ralph Wiggum Loop Pattern

### What it is

The Ralph Wiggum Loop (Geoffrey Huntley, mid-2025) is an iterative pattern:
1. Agent runs against a task
2. External checks (tests, linters, schema validators) determine success/failure
3. On failure, agent receives task again with **fresh context**
4. Progress lives in **files and git**, not in the context window
5. The harness (not the model) decides when work is complete

### How it applies to governance

The current governance loop (startup.md) partially implements this:
- External checks: CI, Copilot recommendations, panel emissions
- Iteration: Max 3 review cycles per PR
- Progress in git: Branch commits, plan files, emissions on disk

**What's missing:** The current loop relies on agent self-assessment. The Ralph pattern would have the harness (Stop hook) reinject governance tasks until all external validators pass.

### Integration opportunity (separate from consolidation)

Wrap governance review in a Ralph loop using Claude Code Stop hooks:
1. **Task:** Review PR against required panels
2. **External validators:** Schema validation, policy engine, CI checks
3. **Loop condition:** All validators pass OR max iterations reached
4. **Fresh context per iteration:** Self-contained review prompts make this possible

This is a **separate follow-up issue**, independent of the consolidation work.

---

## 10. Decision Matrix

| Decision | Choice | Research Basis |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Consolidate personas into review prompts? | **Yes** | Anthropic Voting pattern, Google DeepMind efficiency data, Locality of Behaviour |
| Use MCP Skills instead of markdown prompts? | **No** | Tool count degradation (Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI), Skills ≠ Tools distinction, no infrastructure exists |
| Build orchestrator → sub-prompt decomposition? | **No** | Frontier model decomposition research (arXiv), error propagation risk, no accuracy benefit |
| Build multi-agent runtime now? | **No** | Google DeepMind 39-70% degradation, Anthropic "add complexity only when it improves outcomes" |
| Preserve per-persona emission structure? | **Yes** | Strongest counter-argument; enables weighted aggregation and effectiveness tracking |
| Use shared-perspectives.md for DRY? | **Yes** | Addresses duplication drift; authoring-time DRY with runtime locality |
| Integrate Ralph Wiggum Loop? | **Separate issue** | Independent of consolidation; requires Stop hook implementation |
| Select framework (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen)? | **Defer** | Anthropic: "Frameworks obscure prompts and add unnecessary complexity" |

---

## 11. Recommended Architecture

### Implemented (Issue #220)

1. **19 self-contained review prompts** in `governance/prompts/reviews/` — Anthropic's Voting pattern with inline perspective sections
2. **`shared-perspectives.md`** — Canonical definitions for 19 perspectives appearing in 2+ panels (authoring-time DRY)
3. **Per-persona emission structure preserved** — `findings[].persona` labels unchanged
4. **Workflow references updated** — All 7 workflow files + startup.md point to new prompts
5. **Deprecation notices** — 77 files (58 personas + 19 panels) marked deprecated; 2 agentic personas excluded

### Deferred

- **Ralph Wiggum Loop integration** — Separate follow-up issue (requires Stop hook implementation)
- **True multi-agent runtime** — Deferred per Google DeepMind/Anthropic research
- **MCP Skills conversion** — Not justified for current use case (personas are reasoning roles, not external integrations)
- **Framework selection** — Deferred per Anthropic guidance against premature framework adoption
