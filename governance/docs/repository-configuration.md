# Repository Configuration

The governance framework can configure GitHub repository settings to support the autonomous agentic workflow. Settings are declared in `config.yaml` (defaults) and overridden per-project in `project.yaml`.

## Why This Exists

The agentic loop (startup.md) requires specific GitHub repository settings to function: auto-merge must be enabled so PRs merge after CI + approval, CODEOWNERS must be populated so `require_code_owner_review` rulesets work, and branch protection rulesets must be configured for governance enforcement. Without these settings, the autonomous workflow breaks silently.

Previously, these settings were configured manually per-repository. This feature declares them as code in `config.yaml` and applies them during `init.sh` bootstrap.

## Configuration

### Defaults in `config.yaml`

The `repository` section in `config.yaml` provides framework-wide defaults:

```yaml
repository:
  auto_merge: false  # opt-in: set to true in project.yaml to enable
  delete_branch_on_merge: true
  allow_squash_merge: true
  allow_merge_commit: true
  allow_rebase_merge: true

  codeowners:
    enabled: true
    default_owner: "@SET-Apps/approvers"
    rules:
      - pattern: "/.github/workflows/"
        owners: ["@SET-Apps/devops_engineers"]
      - pattern: "/infra/"
        owners: ["@SET-Apps/devops_engineers"]
      - pattern: "/.ai"
        owners: ["@SET-Apps/approvers"]

  branch_protection:
    expected_rulesets:
      - name: "Pull Request - Reviewer"
        required_approving_review_count: 1
        require_code_owner_review: true
      - name: "Pull Request - Base"
      - name: "JM Compliance Workflow"
```

### Per-Project Overrides in `project.yaml`

Consuming projects can override any default in their `project.yaml`:

```yaml
repository:
  codeowners:
    rules:
      - pattern: "/src/**/Authentication/"
        owners: ["@SET-Apps/security"]
```

Per-project overrides are merged with defaults. Array fields (like `codeowners.rules`) from `project.yaml` are appended to the defaults, not replaced.

### Schema

The `repository` section is validated against `governance/schemas/project.schema.json`.

## How `init.sh` Applies Settings

When `init.sh` runs, after creating symlinks it:

1. **Checks prerequisites** -- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
2. **Detects the GitHub repository** from git remotes
3. **Reads configuration** from `config.yaml` (defaults) and `project.yaml` (overrides)
4. **Creates project directories** (`.plans/`, `.panels/`) with `.gitkeep` files
5. **Applies repository settings** via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} -X PATCH`
6. **Generates CODEOWNERS** if the file is empty or missing
7. **Validates branch protection** by checking expected rulesets exist (warns on mismatch, does not apply)

### Graceful Degradation

Every step degrades gracefully:

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `gh` CLI not installed | Skips repository configuration with instructions to install |
| Not authenticated with `gh` | Skips with instructions to run `gh auth login` |
| Not a GitHub repository | Skips silently |
| Insufficient permissions | Warns and prints manual instructions for a repository admin |
| `config.yaml` has no `repository` section | Skips entirely (backward compatible) |

### Required Permissions

| Operation | Permission Level |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Apply repo settings (auto-merge, merge strategies) | Repository admin |
| Generate CODEOWNERS | Write access (file creation via git) |
| Validate branch protection rulesets | Read access |

## Pre-flight Check in Startup

The agentic startup sequence (`governance/prompts/startup.md`) includes a pre-flight check that verifies repository settings before scanning issues:

1. Checks `allow_auto_merge` is enabled via `gh api`
2. Checks CODEOWNERS file exists and is non-empty
3. If either fails, warns the user and suggests running `bash .ai/init.sh`

This catches misconfiguration before the agentic loop starts, preventing silent failures during PR merge.

## Required Settings for Agentic Loop

| Setting | Required Value | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| `allow_auto_merge` | `true` | PRs auto-merge after CI + approval passes |
| `delete_branch_on_merge` | `true` | Feature branches are cleaned up automatically |
| CODEOWNERS populated | Non-empty file | `require_code_owner_review` rulesets need owners defined |

## Project Directories

`init.sh` creates standard directories in consuming repos for storing governance artifacts. These directories are created in the project root (not inside the `.ai` submodule) so that plans and panel reports are tracked in the consuming repo's own git history.

### Default Directories

| Directory | Purpose | Retention |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `.plans/` | Implementation plans for issues and features | Accumulated — all plans retained |
| `.panels/` | Panel review reports | Latest only — overwrite per panel type |

### Configuration

Directories are declared in `config.yaml` under `project_directories`:

```yaml
project_directories:
  - path: .plans
    description: "Implementation plans for issues and features"
  - path: .panels
    description: "Panel reports — only latest per panel type"
```

Consuming projects can add additional directories in their `project.yaml`. Directory lists from both files are merged (appended).

### Behavior

- Directories are only created in submodule context (consuming repos, not the ai-submodule itself)
- Each directory gets a `.gitkeep` file so git tracks the empty directory
- Idempotent — existing directories are left untouched
- If Python is not available, falls back to the hardcoded defaults (`.plans/` and `.panels/`)

### Panel Report Convention

Panel reports in `.panels/` follow an overwrite strategy: each panel type writes to a fixed filename (e.g., `.panels/security-review.json`), replacing the previous report. This keeps only the latest report per panel type, avoiding repository bloat from accumulated review artifacts.

## CODEOWNERS and Governance Workflow Interaction

The Dark Factory governance workflow (`dark-factory-governance.yml`) approves PRs as `github-actions[bot]`. This creates an interaction with the `require_code_owner_review` org/repo ruleset:

**Problem:** `github-actions[bot]` is a GitHub App, not a user or team. Its approvals do **not** satisfy code owner review requirements. PRs approved only by the governance workflow will be blocked from merging if `require_code_owner_review` is enabled and no code owner has also approved.

### Workarounds

Choose the approach that fits your organization's security posture:

| Approach | Tradeoff |
|----------|----------|
| **Disable `require_code_owner_review`** | Simplest. Governance workflow approval is sufficient. Loses code ownership enforcement. |
| **Add a machine user as code owner** | Create a GitHub user account (not bot) for the agentic workflow. Add it to CODEOWNERS. The workflow must authenticate as this user (via PAT or SSH key). Maintains code ownership but requires credential management. |
| **Add bypass actor to branch ruleset** | Configure the branch protection ruleset to grant `github-actions[bot]` bypass permissions. The governance workflow can then merge without code owner review. Requires org admin access. |
| **Require human code owner review** | Keep `require_code_owner_review` as-is. The governance workflow provides automated review, but a human code owner must also approve before merge. This is the most conservative approach and aligns with `fin_pii_high` and `infrastructure_critical` policy profiles. |

### Recommended Setup by Policy Profile

| Profile | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| `default` | Bypass actor or disable `require_code_owner_review` — agentic loop operates autonomously |
| `fin_pii_high` | Require human code owner review — auto-merge is already disabled, human approval is expected |
| `infrastructure_critical` | Require human code owner review — mandatory architecture and SRE review already in policy |

### ai-submodule Repository

The ai-submodule itself uses `require_code_owner_review: true` in its org ruleset. CODEOWNERS assigns `@SET-Apps/approvers` as the default owner. The governance workflow's `github-actions[bot]` approval satisfies the standard `required_approving_review_count: 1` check but not the code owner check. This works because the branch ruleset grants bypass permissions to the governance workflow.

## Backward Compatibility

The `repository` section is fully optional. If absent from `config.yaml`, `init.sh` skips repository configuration entirely. Existing consuming repos are unaffected until they add the section.

The `project_directories` section is also optional. If absent, `init.sh` falls back to creating `.plans/` and `.panels/` with hardcoded defaults. Existing consuming repos that already have these directories are unaffected (idempotent).
