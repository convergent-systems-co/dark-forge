# Review: API Design Review

## Purpose

Evaluate API design from both provider and consumer perspectives. This panel assesses REST correctness, contract stability, security posture, implementation feasibility, and client integration experience to produce a comprehensive evaluation of the API surface before it is exposed to consumers.

## Context

You are performing an api-design-review. Evaluate the provided API design from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding assessing the API in its domain. The goal is to catch contract issues, breaking change risks, and usability problems before consumers depend on the interface.

> **Shared perspectives:** API Designer, API Consumer, Security Auditor, Backend Engineer, and Frontend Engineer are defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

## Perspectives

### API Designer

**Focus:** REST correctness, idempotent verbs, error semantics, versioning strategy, contract stability.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### API Consumer

**Focus:** Documentation clarity, authentication complexity, error message usefulness, SDK quality, rate limit transparency.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### Security Auditor

**Focus:** Authentication and authorization model, rate limiting, input validation, injection vectors.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### Backend Engineer

**Focus:** Implementation feasibility, database access patterns, caching strategy, performance characteristics.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### Frontend Engineer

**Focus:** Client integration patterns, caching and offline support, bundle size impact, rendering performance.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

## Process

1. **Review API contract and documentation** -- Examine the OpenAPI/Swagger specification, endpoint definitions, request/response schemas, error codes, authentication requirements, and versioning strategy. Understand the intended consumer experience.
2. **Each participant evaluates independently** -- Every perspective analyzes the API through its own lens, producing findings without influence from other perspectives.
3. **Identify breaking change risks** -- Catalog any design decisions that could become breaking changes if modified later. Assess whether the current design locks in assumptions that will be costly to reverse.
4. **Test typical consumer workflows** -- Walk through common consumer use cases end-to-end. Verify that the API supports these workflows without unnecessary complexity, excessive round trips, or ambiguous behavior.
5. **Converge on design improvements** -- Synthesize individual findings into a unified set of recommendations, prioritizing changes that improve consumer experience, security, and long-term evolvability.

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name and role
- Design concerns identified (with evidence from the API contract)
- Usability issues (from the perspective's vantage point)
- Suggested changes (concrete and actionable)

### Consolidated

- Contract issues requiring change (before the API is published)
- Breaking change risks (design decisions that are costly to reverse)
- Documentation gaps (missing examples, unclear error codes, ambiguous behavior)
- Implementation concerns (performance, scalability, feasibility)
- Versioning recommendations (strategy for evolving the API)

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Action on Failure |
|---|---|---|
| Confidence score | >= 0.70 | Request human review |
| Critical findings | 0 | Block API publication |
| High findings | <= 2 | Request changes if exceeded |
| Aggregate verdict | `approve` | Block publication if `block` or `request_changes` |
| Compliance score | >= 0.70 | Escalate to security review |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Formula:** Start with base confidence and deduct per finding severity.

```
confidence = base - (critical * 0.25) - (high * 0.15) - (medium * 0.05) - (low * 0.01)
```

| Finding Severity | Deduction per Finding |
|---|---|
| Critical | -0.25 |
| High | -0.15 |
| Medium | -0.05 |
| Low | -0.01 |

**Base confidence:** 0.85

The final confidence score is clamped to the range [0.0, 1.0]. If the calculated score falls below 0.0, it is reported as 0.0.

## Constraints

- Prioritize backward compatibility in all design recommendations. Breaking changes should be a last resort with a documented migration path for existing consumers.
- Consider multiple client types (web, mobile, server-to-server, CLI) when evaluating the API surface. An API that works well for one client type but poorly for others needs revision.
- Ensure consistent error semantics across all endpoints. Consumers should be able to write a single error-handling path that works regardless of which endpoint returned the error.
- Design for evolution. Every contract decision should be evaluated for how it constrains future changes. Prefer designs that leave room for additive extension.
