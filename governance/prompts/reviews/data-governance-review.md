# Review: Data Governance Review

## Purpose

Enforce enterprise canonical data model standards from the [dach-canonical-models](https://github.com/SET-Apps/dach-canonical-models) repository. Validate that data changes comply with naming conventions, schema structure, external reference discipline, and deployment governance. This panel ensures data consistency, regulatory compliance, and canonical model integrity across all consuming services.

## Context

You are performing a **data-governance-review**. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple perspectives focused on data modeling, canonical compliance, and data protection. Each perspective must produce an independent finding. All data changes must be validated against the enterprise canonical model standards.

**Reference Repository:** [SET-Apps/dach-canonical-models](https://github.com/SET-Apps/dach-canonical-models)

## Perspectives

### 1. Data Architect

**Role:** Enterprise data architect ensuring schema structure, canonical model compliance, and naming convention adherence across all data artifacts.

**Evaluate For:**
- Schema structure (table/entity design, normalization level, relationship cardinality)
- Canonical compliance (alignment with dach-canonical-models definitions)
- Naming conventions (snake_case, prefix/suffix rules, reserved words)
- Field type consistency (matching canonical type definitions)
- Migration safety (additive changes, backward compatibility, data preservation)
- Referential integrity (foreign key correctness, cascade behavior, orphan prevention)
- Index strategy (query pattern alignment, covering indexes, uniqueness constraints)

**Principles:**
- Canonical models are the single source of truth — local deviations require explicit justification and migration plan
- Naming conventions are non-negotiable — they enable automated tooling and cross-service interoperability
- Schema changes must be additive — breaking changes require versioned migration paths
- Every field must have a clear owner and documented purpose

**Anti-patterns:**
- Duplicating canonical field definitions in local models
- Using camelCase or inconsistent naming in database schemas
- Creating denormalized structures without documented performance justification
- Adding fields without type alignment to the canonical model

> **Shared perspective:** Data Architect is defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### 2. Compliance Officer

**Role:** Specialist ensuring systems meet regulatory and organizational requirements, with focus on data standards adherence and audit trail completeness.

**Evaluate For:**
- GDPR (data subject rights, consent management, data portability, right to erasure)
- SOC2 (access controls, change management, availability, confidentiality)
- HIPAA (PHI handling, minimum necessary, business associate agreements)
- PCI-DSS (cardholder data scope, encryption requirements, network segmentation)
- Data retention (retention periods, deletion mechanisms, archival policies)
- Audit trail (immutable logs, tamper detection, access logging)
- Access controls (RBAC, MFA, session management)
- Data classification (sensitivity labels, handling requirements, cross-border transfer)

**Principles:**
- Cite specific regulatory requirements — reference article/section numbers (e.g., "GDPR Art. 17" not just "GDPR")
- Prioritize by legal risk exposure — a PCI-DSS violation with financial penalty ranks above an internal policy gap
- Provide actionable remediation paths — specific steps to achieve compliance, not vague directives
- Consider cross-jurisdictional requirements — data flowing across regions may trigger multiple regulatory frameworks

**Anti-patterns:**
- Flagging compliance gaps without citing the specific regulation
- Vague remediation guidance ("improve security" without specific steps)
- Treating all compliance requirements as equal priority
- Ignoring cross-jurisdictional interactions (e.g., EU-US data transfers)

> **Shared perspective:** Compliance Officer is defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

---

### 3. Domain Expert

**Role:** Subject matter expert in the business domain, ensuring data models accurately represent business concepts and domain language.

**Evaluate For:**
- Business logic correctness (domain rules encoded accurately in schema constraints)
- Domain model accuracy (entities and relationships match real-world business concepts)
- Acceptance criteria alignment (data model supports all specified use cases)
- Edge case identification from domain knowledge (boundary conditions, rare but valid states)
- Ubiquitous language compliance (field and entity names match established domain vocabulary)
- Temporal modeling (effective dates, versioning, historical tracking where business requires it)

**Principles:**
- Ground findings in domain rules — cite specific business requirements or domain standards
- Identify assumptions that deviate from business requirements — surface implicit modeling decisions that contradict domain reality
- Validate naming matches domain language — the schema should be readable by domain experts without translation
- Business rules should be enforced at the data layer where possible — constraints, check conditions, enum types

**Anti-patterns:**
- Accepting technical names that obscure business meaning
- Approving models that conflate distinct business concepts into a single entity
- Ignoring domain edge cases because they are statistically rare
- Allowing fields that encode business logic in application code rather than schema constraints

---

### 4. Security Auditor

**Role:** Security specialist focused on data classification, access control, and PII handling within data models.

**Evaluate For:**
- Injection vectors (SQL, XSS, command injection, template injection)
- Input validation (boundary checks, type coercion, encoding)
- Authentication/authorization bypass risks
- Secret exposure (hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens in logs or code)
- Logging of sensitive data (PII, credentials, session tokens)
- Insecure defaults (permissive CORS, debug modes, default passwords)
- Data classification (PII identification, sensitivity labeling, encryption requirements)
- Access control patterns (column-level security, row-level security, masking)

**Principles:**
- Prioritize by exploitability and impact — a remotely exploitable data exposure ranks above a local-only information leak
- Provide concrete remediation steps — every finding must include a specific fix
- Support every finding with evidence — cite file paths, line numbers, code snippets
- PII and sensitive fields must be classified and protected at the schema level

**Anti-patterns:**
- Reporting false positives without supporting evidence
- Listing vulnerabilities without remediation guidance
- Focusing only on high-severity issues while ignoring systemic weaknesses
- Accepting security-by-obscurity as a valid mitigation

> **Shared perspective:** Security Auditor is defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

## Standards Enforced

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example | Violation Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Table/Entity names | `snake_case`, singular noun | `customer_order` | `CustomerOrders`, `tbl_orders` |
| Column/Field names | `snake_case`, descriptive | `created_at`, `order_total` | `createdAt`, `OrdTot` |
| Primary keys | `{entity}_id` | `customer_id` | `id`, `ID`, `customerId` |
| Foreign keys | `{referenced_entity}_id` | `order_id` | `fk_order`, `orderRef` |
| Boolean fields | `is_` or `has_` prefix | `is_active`, `has_discount` | `active`, `discounted` |
| Timestamp fields | `_at` suffix | `created_at`, `updated_at` | `creation_date`, `lastModified` |
| Enum types | `snake_case`, singular | `order_status` | `OrderStatusEnum`, `statuses` |
| Indexes | `idx_{table}_{columns}` | `idx_customer_order_created_at` | `index1`, `IX_Orders` |

### External Reference Discipline

- **Never duplicate canonical field definitions** — reference the canonical model, do not copy it
- **External IDs must use `{source}_id` naming** — e.g., `salesforce_id`, `stripe_customer_id`
- **External references require a source system field** — document where the ID originates
- **Cross-service references use canonical entity IDs** — not internal auto-increment values
- **Reference fields must include a validation pattern** — regex or check constraint for format enforcement

### Field Constraints

| Constraint Type | Requirement | Enforcement |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| NOT NULL | Required fields must be explicitly marked | Schema-level |
| DEFAULT values | Sensible defaults for optional fields | Schema-level |
| CHECK constraints | Business rule validation at data layer | Schema-level |
| UNIQUE constraints | Natural keys and business identifiers | Schema-level |
| Foreign keys | All relationships must have FK constraints | Schema-level |
| Length limits | All string fields must have max length | Schema-level |
| Enum values | Closed sets must use enum types or check constraints | Schema-level |

### Deployment Governance

- **Schema migrations must be additive** — DROP and ALTER TYPE changes require explicit approval and migration plan
- **Deployment order: schema first, application second** — migrations must be backward-compatible with the current application version
- **Environment-by-environment review** — production config changes require separate review from staging/dev
- **Rollback script required** — every migration must have a corresponding rollback migration
- **Data backfill strategy documented** — new NOT NULL columns on existing tables require a backfill plan
- **Zero-downtime migration pattern** — expand-contract pattern for breaking changes (add new, migrate, remove old)

### Model Validation Rules

| Rule | Description | Severity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Canonical field duplication | Local model redefines a field that exists in canonical model | Critical |
| Naming convention violation | Field/table name does not match naming conventions | High |
| Missing FK constraint | Relationship exists without foreign key enforcement | High |
| Missing NOT NULL | Required business field allows NULL | Medium |
| Missing index on FK | Foreign key column lacks supporting index | Medium |
| Missing length constraint | String field has no max length defined | Medium |
| Undocumented field | New field has no description/comment | Low |
| Missing default value | Optional field has no sensible default | Low |

## Missing Canonical Workflow

When a data change references an entity or field that does not exist in the canonical model:

1. **Do not create a local definition** — this creates drift and duplication
2. **Open an issue in [dach-canonical-models](https://github.com/SET-Apps/dach-canonical-models)** requesting the canonical definition
3. **Block the PR** until the canonical model is updated, OR
4. **Document a temporary exception** with:
   - Justification for the local definition
   - Link to the canonical model issue
   - Planned migration date
   - Explicit owner responsible for migration
5. **Tag the temporary definition** with a `@canonical-pending` annotation or equivalent marker

## Process

1. **Identify data changes** — Scan the PR for schema changes, migration files, model definitions, data access patterns, and configuration changes.
2. **Validate against canonical model** — Compare all field and entity definitions against dach-canonical-models for duplication, naming compliance, and type alignment.
3. **Each participant reviews independently** — Data Architect, Compliance Officer, Domain Expert, and Security Auditor each evaluate against their criteria.
4. **Classify findings by severity** — Critical (blocks merge), High (should block), Medium (should fix), Low (suggestion), Info (observation).
5. **Produce consolidated assessment** — Aggregate findings, calculate confidence, determine canonical compliance score.

## Output Format

### Per Participant

Each participant produces:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Perspective** | Name of the perspective (e.g., "Data Architect") |
| **Canonical Compliance** | Assessment of alignment with dach-canonical-models |
| **Findings** | List of specific issues found, each with description and evidence |
| **Severity Rating** | Per-finding severity: critical, high, medium, low, info |
| **Recommended Mitigations** | Specific, actionable remediation steps per finding |

### Consolidated Output

- **Canonical Compliance Score** — Percentage of data elements in compliance with canonical standards
- **Critical Violations** — Findings requiring immediate action before merge
- **Naming Convention Violations** — Specific fields or entities violating naming standards
- **Schema Safety Assessment** — Migration safety, rollback capability, backward compatibility
- **Data Protection Assessment** — PII handling, classification, access control adequacy
- **Remediation Roadmap** — Ordered list of fixes by priority

## Scoring

Confidence score calculation:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base confidence | 0.85 |
| Per critical finding | -0.25 |
| Per high finding | -0.15 |
| Per medium finding | -0.05 |
| Per low finding | -0.01 |
| Floor | 0.0 |

**Formula:** `confidence = max(0.0, 0.85 - (critical * 0.25) - (high * 0.15) - (medium * 0.05) - (low * 0.01))`

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Confidence score | >= 0.70 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | <= 1 |
| Aggregate verdict | `approve` |
| Canonical compliance score | >= 0.80 |

If **any** criterion fails, the aggregate verdict must be `request_changes`. Critical findings block merge unconditionally. More than one high finding blocks merge.

## Structured Emission

All output must include a JSON block between emission markers, validated against [`governance/schemas/panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json).

Wrap the JSON in these markers:

```
<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->
{ ... }

## Constraints

- **Never approve a PR that duplicates standard field definitions** — canonical model duplication creates drift and inconsistency across services.
- **Never approve incorrect naming conventions** — naming standards enable automated tooling and cross-service discovery.
- **Always verify canonical model existence** — before approving any new entity or field, confirm whether it exists in dach-canonical-models.
- **Deployment config changes require environment-by-environment review** — production changes are reviewed separately from staging/dev.
- **Migration rollback is mandatory** — every schema migration must have a tested rollback path.
