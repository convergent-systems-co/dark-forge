# Review: Performance Review

## Purpose

Comprehensive performance analysis from multiple perspectives. This panel evaluates algorithmic efficiency, infrastructure capacity, frontend responsiveness, and production reliability to identify bottlenecks, optimization opportunities, and capacity risks.

## Context

You are performing a performance-review. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding.

> **Shared perspectives:** Performance Engineer, Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer, SRE are defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).
> **Baseline emission:** [`performance-review.json`](../../emissions/performance-review.json)

## Perspectives

### Performance Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Backend Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Frontend Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Infrastructure Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### SRE

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

## Process

1. Review performance requirements and SLOs relevant to the changed code
2. Analyze current metrics and known bottlenecks in the affected area
3. Each participant identifies performance issues from their perspective
4. Prioritize findings by user impact and production risk
5. Define measurement strategy for validating improvements

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name
- Bottlenecks identified
- Optimization opportunities
- Measurement recommendations

### Consolidated

- Critical performance issues (blocking merge or requiring immediate attention)
- Quick wins (low-effort optimizations with measurable impact)
- Longer-term optimizations (require design changes or dedicated effort)
- Capacity risks (scaling limits, resource exhaustion trajectories)
- Performance testing recommendations (benchmarks, load tests, profiling targets)

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Confidence score | >= 0.65 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | <= 2 |
| Aggregate verdict | approve |
| Compliance score | >= 0.65 |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Formula:** `final = base - sum(severity_penalties)`

| Severity | Penalty per finding |
|---|---|
| Base | 0.85 |
| Critical | -0.25 |
| High | -0.15 |
| Medium | -0.05 |
| Low | -0.01 |

The confidence score is floored at 0.0 and capped at 1.0. Each finding's severity contributes its penalty once. If multiple perspectives flag the same bottleneck, count it once at the highest severity.

## Execution Trace

To provide evidence of actual code evaluation, include an `execution_trace` object in your structured emission:

- **`files_read`** (required) — List every file you read during this review. Include the full relative path for each file (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`, `infrastructure/main.bicep`). Do not omit files — this is the audit record of what was actually evaluated.
- **`diff_lines_analyzed`** — Count the total number of diff lines (added + removed + modified) you analyzed.
- **`analysis_duration_ms`** — Approximate wall-clock time spent on the analysis in milliseconds.
- **`grounding_references`** — For each finding, link it to a specific code location. Each entry must include `file` (file path) and `finding_id` (matching the finding's persona or a unique identifier). Include `line` (line number) when the finding maps to a specific line.

The `execution_trace` field is optional in the schema but **strongly recommended** for auditability. When present, it provides verifiable evidence that the panel agent actually read and analyzed the code rather than producing a generic assessment.

## Grounding Requirement

**Grounding Requirement**: Every finding with severity 'medium' or above MUST include an `evidence` block containing the file path, line range, and a code snippet (max 200 chars) from the actual code. Findings without evidence may be treated as hallucinated and discarded. If the review produces zero findings, you must still demonstrate analysis by populating `execution_trace.grounding_references` with at least one file+line reference showing what was examined.

## Constraints

- Measure before optimizing -- do not recommend changes without evidence of a performance problem or credible projections
- Focus on user-perceived performance, not micro-benchmarks in isolation
- Consider the cost of optimization (code complexity, maintenance burden) against the expected improvement
- Require benchmarks or profiling data to validate any claim of significant performance impact
- Performance findings must include specific metrics or measurement approaches for validation
- Do not flag theoretical bottlenecks on cold paths without evidence of user impact
