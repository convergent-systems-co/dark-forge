# Review: Testing Review

## Purpose

Evaluate test coverage, quality, and testing approach comprehensively. This panel assesses the adequacy of the test portfolio, identifies gaps in coverage, and evaluates the reliability and maintainability of existing tests.

## Context

You are performing a testing-review. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding.

> **Shared perspectives:** Test Engineer, Failure Engineer, Performance Engineer, Security Auditor, Code Reviewer are defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

## Perspectives

### Test Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Failure Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Performance Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Security Auditor

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Code Reviewer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

## Process

1. Review the current test portfolio and its relationship to the code change
2. Each participant identifies coverage gaps from their perspective
3. Assess test reliability and maintenance burden
4. Prioritize improvements by risk reduction impact

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name
- Coverage gaps identified
- Quality concerns (flakiness, determinism, isolation)
- Recommended test additions

### Consolidated

- Critical untested paths (code paths that lack any test coverage and handle critical logic)
- Flaky test risks (tests that are non-deterministic or environment-dependent)
- Testing infrastructure needs (tooling, fixtures, CI configuration)
- Prioritized test backlog (ordered by risk reduction impact)
- Confidence assessment (overall confidence in the test portfolio's ability to catch regressions)

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Confidence score | >= 0.70 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | <= 2 |
| Aggregate verdict | approve |
| Compliance score | >= 0.70 |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Formula:** `final = base - sum(severity_penalties)`

| Severity | Penalty per finding |
|---|---|
| Base | 0.85 |
| Critical | -0.25 |
| High | -0.15 |
| Medium | -0.05 |
| Low | -0.01 |

The confidence score is floored at 0.0 and capped at 1.0. Each finding's severity contributes its penalty once. If multiple perspectives flag the same gap, count it once at the highest severity.

## Constraints

- Prefer integration tests for critical paths over unit tests with heavy mocking
- Balance coverage breadth with maintenance cost -- do not recommend tests that cost more to maintain than the risk they mitigate
- Tests document expected behavior -- assess whether existing tests serve as reliable specifications
- Avoid recommending tests that are tightly coupled to implementation details
- Identify flaky tests and recommend root-cause fixes, not retries or skips
- Every coverage gap finding must include a specific test scenario recommendation
