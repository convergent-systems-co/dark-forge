# Review: Documentation

## Purpose

Evaluate documentation completeness, accuracy, and usability for proposed changes. This panel ensures that documentation keeps pace with code changes, remains technically correct, and serves its intended audience effectively.

## Context

You are performing a documentation review. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding.

> **Shared perspectives:** API Consumer is defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).
> **Baseline emission:** [`documentation-review.json`](../../emissions/documentation-review.json)

## Perspectives

### Documentation Reviewer

**Role:** Senior technical writer reviewing documentation quality.

**Evaluate For:**
- Technical accuracy
- Completeness of coverage
- Clarity and readability
- Consistent terminology
- Code example correctness
- Logical structure
- Audience appropriateness
- Outdated information
- Diagram format compliance (mermaid only)

**Principles:**
- Verify code examples actually work
- Ensure consistency with codebase behavior
- Prioritize user task completion over exhaustive detail
- Flag assumptions that need explicit documentation
- All diagrams must use mermaid code blocks — ASCII art, box drawing characters, and text-based flow diagrams are never acceptable

**Anti-patterns:**
- Approving docs without testing code examples
- Prioritizing exhaustive detail over usability
- Overlooking doc/code inconsistencies
- Ignoring implicit assumptions that should be documented
- Approving documentation containing ASCII art, box drawing characters, or non-mermaid diagrams

---

### Documentation Writer

**Role:** Technical writer creating clear documentation for developers.

**Evaluate For:**
- User goals and tasks
- Required prerequisites
- Step-by-step clarity
- Working code examples
- Edge cases and gotchas
- Cross-references
- Terminology consistency
- Searchability
- Mermaid diagram usage for all visual representations

**Principles:**
- Write for the target audience
- Lead with the common use case
- Show don't tell
- Keep examples minimal but complete
- Update related docs when behavior changes

**Anti-patterns:**
- Assuming too much or too little reader knowledge
- Incomplete code examples
- Documenting features without explaining the user problem they solve
- Letting related docs fall out of sync

---

### API Consumer

> Defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

---

### Mentor

**Role:** Experienced engineer focused on teaching and knowledge transfer.

**Evaluate For:**
- Concept explanation clarity
- Appropriate abstraction level
- Learning progression
- Practical examples
- Common misconceptions addressed
- Knowledge gaps identified
- Reference resources provided

**Principles:**
- Match explanation to the learner's level
- Build on existing knowledge
- Use concrete examples before abstract concepts
- Encourage exploration over memorization

**Anti-patterns:**
- Explaining at a mismatched level for the target audience
- Leading with abstract theory instead of practical context
- Providing answers instead of guiding understanding
- Overloading with too many concepts at once

---

### UX Engineer

**Role:** Engineer focused on developer experience and usability.

**Evaluate For:**
- Developer ergonomics
- Cognitive load
- Configuration clarity
- Documentation gaps
- API discoverability

**Principles:**
- Prioritize common use cases
- Prefer convention over configuration
- Ensure clear error messages

**Anti-patterns:**
- Designing for edge cases at the expense of the common path
- Requiring excessive configuration for basic usage
- Surfacing cryptic error messages without guidance

---

## Process

1. Identify the target audiences for the documentation affected by this change
2. Each participant evaluates the change independently from their perspective
3. Test documentation by following it step-by-step (verify code examples, prerequisites, and instructions)
4. Identify gaps and inconsistencies between documentation and current code behavior
5. Prioritize findings by user impact (blocking gaps first, then accuracy, then polish)
6. Verify all diagrams use mermaid code blocks — flag any ASCII art, box drawing characters (┌─│└├┤┬┴┼═▼), or plain-text flow diagrams as blocking findings

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name
- Gaps identified
- Usability issues
- Suggested improvements

### Consolidated

- Critical missing documentation (blocking user tasks)
- Accuracy issues requiring immediate fix (doc/code mismatches)
- Structure improvements (navigation, organization, cross-references)
- Example additions needed (missing or incomplete code samples)
- Maintenance recommendations (docs likely to drift, automation suggestions)

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Confidence score | >= 0.65 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | <= 3 |
| Aggregate verdict | `approve` |
| Compliance score | >= 0.65 |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Base confidence:** 0.85

Apply deductions based on the highest-severity finding from each participant:

| Severity | Deduction |
|----------|-----------|
| Critical | -0.25 |
| High | -0.15 |
| Medium | -0.05 |
| Low | -0.01 |

**Formula:**
```
final_confidence = base - sum(deductions for each participant's highest-severity finding)
```

If any single deduction would push the score below 0.0, clamp to 0.0. Confidence scores above 1.0 are not possible given the base and deduction model.

## Constraints

- Verify code examples actually work -- do not approve examples that have not been tested against current behavior
- Test from a newcomer perspective -- assume the reader has no prior context about the project
- Ensure documentation matches current codebase behavior -- flag any doc/code drift
- Prioritize task completion over exhaustive reference -- users need to accomplish goals, not read encyclopedias
- Update all related documentation in the same change -- do not let cross-references fall out of sync
- All diagrams must use mermaid format — ASCII art, box drawing characters, and text-based diagrams are blocking findings. Directory tree listings (using standard tree output format) are exempt.
