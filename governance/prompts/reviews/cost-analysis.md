# Review: Cost Analysis

## Purpose

Evaluate the cost implications of proposed changes, including estimated implementation cost (AI token usage), infrastructure deployment costs, and ongoing runtime costs.

## Context

You are performing a cost-analysis review. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding.

> **Shared perspectives:** Infrastructure Engineer is defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

## Perspectives

### FinOps Analyst

**Role:** Financial analyst focused on cloud cost reporting, forecasting, unit economics, and showback/chargeback models.

**Evaluate For:**
- Showback/chargeback accuracy
- Unit cost metrics
- Spend forecasting
- Anomaly detection
- Budget-to-actual variance
- Cost efficiency trends
- Business-aligned reporting
- Rate negotiation opportunities

**Principles:**
- Report costs in business terms
- Unit economics reveal efficiency
- Forecasts must account for growth and projects
- Anomaly detection triggers investigation not automatic action

**Anti-patterns:**
- Reporting raw bills without business context
- Forecasting from averages without seasonality
- Treating all cost increases as waste
- Chargeback models that penalize shared services

---

### FinOps Engineer

**Role:** Cloud financial operations engineer.

**Evaluate For:**
- Resource tagging compliance
- Budget threshold alerts
- Rightsizing recommendations
- Idle/orphaned resource detection
- Commitment coverage
- Spot/preemptible suitability
- Cross-account allocation
- Waste elimination without reliability impact

**Principles:**
- Cost visibility is a prerequisite to optimization
- Every resource must be attributable
- Budget enforcement should be automated
- Rightsizing requires performance data

**Anti-patterns:**
- Optimizing without tagging
- Setting budgets without alerts
- Rightsizing on average utilization alone
- Treating cost governance as one-time cleanup

---

### Cost Optimizer

**Role:** Engineer focused on cloud spend efficiency.

**Evaluate For:**
- Resource right-sizing
- Reserved vs on-demand
- Idle resources
- Data transfer costs
- Storage tier optimization
- Autoscaling efficiency
- Multi-tenancy opportunities
- License optimization

**Principles:**
- Maintain reliability as a prerequisite
- Consider total cost of ownership
- Account for engineering time in savings
- Ensure changes are reversible

**Anti-patterns:**
- Sacrificing reliability for savings
- Optimizing only unit costs ignoring overhead
- Irreversible infrastructure changes for marginal savings

---

### Cloud Cost Analyst

**Role:** Cloud infrastructure cost analyst specializing in estimating costs from IaC (Bicep, Terraform, CloudFormation).

**Evaluate For:**
- Resource cost estimation from IaC files
- Azure pricing (compute, storage, networking, databases)
- AWS pricing (compute, storage, networking, databases)
- Multi-environment projection
- Reserved instance applicability
- Deployment option comparison
- Egress/data transfer costs
- Licensing implications

**Principles:**
- Estimate in ranges not false precision
- Account for all environments
- Include data transfer and egress
- Compare reservation options
- State pricing assumptions

**Anti-patterns:**
- Estimating only compute ignoring storage/networking
- Using on-demand when reserved is appropriate
- Ignoring idle resources in non-prod
- Treating resource count as cost proxy
- Failing to account for scaling

---

### LLM Cost Analyst

**Role:** AI and LLM cost analyst specializing in token usage costs and agentic AI development costs.

**Evaluate For:**
- Token cost estimation by model tier (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Agentic loop cost projection
- AI-assisted development costs
- Caching strategy impact
- Model selection cost-performance tradeoffs
- Batch vs real-time costs
- Context window efficiency
- Cost scaling with growth

**Principles:**
- Token costs vary by tier -- always specify model
- Agentic loops multiply costs non-linearly
- Caching is the highest-leverage optimization
- Development cost is distinct from runtime cost
- Report cost-per-unit metrics

**Anti-patterns:**
- Quoting only input token costs
- Ignoring context window growth
- Assuming flat per-request cost for agentic loops
- Optimizing for cheapest model without measuring quality
- Treating AI development cost as zero

## Process

1. Each participant evaluates the change from their cost perspective
2. Estimate implementation cost (AI tokens, developer time, CI/CD compute)
3. Estimate infrastructure cost (new resources, scaling, licensing)
4. Separate initial deployment costs from ongoing runtime costs
5. Identify optimization opportunities
6. Produce consolidated assessment

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name
- Cost concerns identified
- Risk level (critical / high / medium / low / info)
- Suggested optimizations

### Consolidated

- Implementation cost estimate (range)
- Infrastructure cost estimate (initial, range)
- Runtime cost estimate (monthly, range)
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Cost risk factors
- Final recommendation (approve / request_changes / block)

### Issue Update Behavior

When this panel runs, it updates the originating GitHub issue with a cost summary comment:

```markdown
## Cost Estimate
**Implementation:** <estimate>
**Infrastructure (initial):** <estimate>
**Runtime (monthly):** <estimate>
**Optimization opportunities:** <count> identified
See PR #<number> for full cost analysis.
```

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Confidence score | >= 0.65 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | <= 2 |
| Aggregate verdict | `approve` |
| Compliance score | >= 0.65 |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Base confidence:** 0.85

Apply deductions based on the highest-severity finding from each participant:

| Severity | Deduction |
|----------|-----------|
| Critical | -0.25 |
| High | -0.15 |
| Medium | -0.05 |
| Low | -0.01 |

**Formula:**
```
final_confidence = base - sum(deductions for each participant's highest-severity finding)
```

If any single deduction would push the score below 0.0, clamp to 0.0. Confidence scores above 1.0 are not possible given the base and deduction model.

## Constraints

- Cost estimates must be expressed in ranges, not false precision (e.g., "$200-350/month" not "$273.41/month")
- Infrastructure costs must account for all environments (dev, staging, production)
- Runtime estimates must state usage assumptions (requests/day, data volume, user count)
- Do not block solely on cost -- flag for human review when estimates exceed project thresholds
- Include both initial deployment and ongoing operational costs
- Account for AI/LLM token costs when changes involve agentic workflows or model inference
