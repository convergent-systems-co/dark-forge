# Review: Code Review

## Purpose

Comprehensive code evaluation from multiple engineering perspectives. This panel examines correctness, security, performance, testability, and maintainability to produce a holistic assessment of production readiness.

## Context

You are performing a code-review. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding.

> **Shared perspectives:** Security Auditor, Performance Engineer, Test Engineer, Refactor Specialist are defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).
> **Baseline emission:** [`code-review.json`](../../emissions/code-review.json)

## Perspectives

### Code Reviewer

**Role:** Senior engineer performing strict production-level review focusing on correctness, safety, and runtime behavior.

**Evaluate For:**
- Correctness under concurrent access
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error handling completeness
- Security risks
- Idempotency and retry safety
- Hidden mutable state
- Performance on hot paths
- Resource lifecycle

**Principles:**
- Every finding must include concrete remediation
- Focus on runtime behavior not aesthetics
- Prioritize by production impact
- Support findings with evidence

**Anti-patterns:**
- Style nitpicks unless they impact correctness
- Speculative criticism without failure scenario
- Suggesting rewrites when targeted fixes suffice
- Flagging theoretical performance issues without evidence

### Security Auditor

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Performance Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Test Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Refactor Specialist

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

## Process

1. Each participant reviews the code change independently
2. Present findings with severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
3. Identify conflicting recommendations across perspectives
4. Produce consolidated assessment with final recommendation

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name
- Key concerns
- Risk level
- Suggested changes

### Consolidated

- Must-fix items (blocking merge)
- Should-fix items (strongly recommended)
- Consider items (non-blocking suggestions)
- Tradeoff summary (conflicts between perspectives and resolution reasoning)
- Final recommendation (Approve / Request Changes / Reject)

## Execution Trace

To provide evidence of actual code evaluation, include an `execution_trace` object in your structured emission:

- **`files_read`** (required) — List every file you read during this review. Include the full relative path for each file (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`, `infrastructure/main.bicep`). Do not omit files — this is the audit record of what was actually evaluated.
- **`diff_lines_analyzed`** — Count the total number of diff lines (added + removed + modified) you analyzed.
- **`analysis_duration_ms`** — Approximate wall-clock time spent on the analysis in milliseconds.
- **`grounding_references`** — For each finding, link it to a specific code location. Each entry must include `file` (file path) and `finding_id` (matching the finding's persona or a unique identifier). Include `line` (line number) when the finding maps to a specific line.

The `execution_trace` field is optional in the schema but **strongly recommended** for auditability. When present, it provides verifiable evidence that the panel agent actually read and analyzed the code rather than producing a generic assessment.

## Grounding Requirement

**Grounding Requirement**: Every finding with severity 'medium' or above MUST include an `evidence` block containing the file path, line range, and a code snippet (max 200 chars) from the actual code. Findings without evidence may be treated as hallucinated and discarded. If the review produces zero findings, you must still demonstrate analysis by populating `execution_trace.grounding_references` with at least one file+line reference showing what was examined.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Confidence score | >= 0.70 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | <= 2 |
| Aggregate verdict | approve |
| Compliance score | >= 0.70 |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Formula:** `final = base - sum(severity_penalties)`

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base confidence | 0.85 |
| Per critical finding | -0.25 |
| Per high finding | -0.15 |
| Per medium finding | -0.05 |
| Per low finding | -0.01 |
| Floor | 0.0 |
| Cap | 1.0 |

Each finding's severity contributes its penalty once. If multiple perspectives flag the same issue, count it once at the highest severity. The score is floored at 0.0 and capped at 1.0.
## Canary Calibration Input

When a code snippet is provided with a `# CANARY INPUT` comment marker, evaluate it with the same rigor as production code. Report findings using the standard finding format. Canary inputs test calibration — they contain known issues that a thorough review must detect. Do not treat canary inputs differently from production code.

## Constraints

- Focus on substantive issues that affect correctness, security, or reliability -- not style preferences
- Resolve conflicts between perspectives with explicit reasoning and tradeoff analysis
- Provide concrete remediation for every finding rated Medium or above
- Do not suggest rewrites when targeted, incremental fixes address the concern
- Every finding must reference specific code locations
