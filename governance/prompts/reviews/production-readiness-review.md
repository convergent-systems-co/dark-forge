# Review: Production Readiness Review

## Purpose

Assess whether a system is ready for production deployment. This panel evaluates operational maturity across reliability, infrastructure, observability, resilience, and delivery pipeline dimensions to determine if the system meets the bar for serving production traffic.

## Context

You are performing a production-readiness-review. Evaluate the provided system from multiple operational perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding assessing readiness in its domain. The goal is to identify launch blockers, accepted risks, and post-launch requirements.

> **Shared perspectives:** SRE, Infrastructure Engineer, Observability Engineer, Failure Engineer, and DevOps Engineer are defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).
> **Baseline emission:** [`production-readiness-review.json`](../../emissions/production-readiness-review.json)

## Perspectives

### SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)

**Focus:** SLO definitions, error budgets, runbook completeness, on-call readiness, capacity planning.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### Infrastructure Engineer

**Focus:** Deployment topology, security posture, networking, least privilege, rollback safety.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### Observability Engineer

**Focus:** Logging completeness, metric coverage, distributed tracing, alert signal-to-noise, dashboard usefulness.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### Failure Engineer

**Focus:** Recovery procedures, rollback capability, graceful degradation, partial failure handling.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### DevOps Engineer

**Focus:** CI/CD pipeline health, artifact immutability, environment parity, secret handling, drift detection.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

## Process

1. **Review deployment architecture** -- Examine infrastructure diagrams, deployment configurations, scaling policies, and environment topology. Understand what is being deployed and where.
2. **Each participant assesses operational readiness** -- Every perspective independently evaluates the system's readiness in its domain, referencing checklists, standards, and operational experience.
3. **Identify gaps in observability and recovery** -- Surface blind spots in monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting. Verify that recovery procedures exist, are documented, and have been tested.
4. **Evaluate incident response capability** -- Assess whether the team can detect, diagnose, and resolve production issues. Check for runbooks, escalation paths, and on-call coverage.
5. **Determine launch blockers vs follow-ups** -- Classify findings as launch blockers (must resolve before deployment) or follow-ups (acceptable post-launch with a tracked timeline).

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name and role
- Readiness gaps identified (with severity and evidence)
- Risk level for each gap (critical / high / medium / low / info)
- Required before launch (specific actions that block deployment)

### Consolidated

- Launch blockers (must resolve before production deployment)
- Launch risks (accepted with documented mitigation strategy)
- Post-launch requirements (with owners and deadlines)
- Operational runbook status (complete / partial / missing per critical path)
- Go/No-Go recommendation

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Action on Failure |
|---|---|---|
| Confidence score | >= 0.75 | Request human review |
| Critical findings | 0 | Block launch |
| High findings | <= 1 | Block launch if exceeded |
| Aggregate verdict | `approve` | Block launch if `block` or `request_changes` |
| Compliance score | >= 0.80 | Escalate to policy review |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Formula:** `final = base - sum(severity_penalties)`

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base confidence | 0.85 |
| Per critical finding | -0.25 |
| Per high finding | -0.15 |
| Per medium finding | -0.05 |
| Per low finding | -0.01 |
| Floor | 0.0 |
| Cap | 1.0 |

## Execution Trace

To provide evidence of actual code evaluation, include an `execution_trace` object in your structured emission:

- **`files_read`** (required) — List every file you read during this review. Include the full relative path for each file (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`, `infrastructure/main.bicep`). Do not omit files — this is the audit record of what was actually evaluated.
- **`diff_lines_analyzed`** — Count the total number of diff lines (added + removed + modified) you analyzed.
- **`analysis_duration_ms`** — Approximate wall-clock time spent on the analysis in milliseconds.
- **`grounding_references`** — For each finding, link it to a specific code location. Each entry must include `file` (file path) and `finding_id` (matching the finding's persona or a unique identifier). Include `line` (line number) when the finding maps to a specific line.

The `execution_trace` field is optional in the schema but **strongly recommended** for auditability. When present, it provides verifiable evidence that the panel agent actually read and analyzed the code rather than producing a generic assessment.

## Grounding Requirement

**Grounding Requirement**: Every finding with severity 'medium' or above MUST include an `evidence` block containing the file path, line range, and a code snippet (max 200 chars) from the actual code. Findings without evidence may be treated as hallucinated and discarded. If the review produces zero findings, you must still demonstrate analysis by populating `execution_trace.grounding_references` with at least one file+line reference showing what was examined.

Each finding's severity contributes its penalty once. If multiple perspectives flag the same issue, count it once at the highest severity. The score is floored at 0.0 and capped at 1.0.
## Constraints

- Ensure rollback capability exists and has been tested for every deployment mechanism in use
- Verify alerting covers all critical paths, including background processing and async workflows
- Require runbooks for all known failure modes before granting production readiness
- Document accepted risks explicitly, including the mitigation strategy and the conditions under which the risk must be revisited
