# Review: Test Generation Review

## Purpose

Evaluate test coverage, verification requirements, and proof-of-correctness criteria for code changes. Emits structured test requirements as JSON. This panel does not execute tests -- it assesses test governance by determining what tests are required, at what verification level, and whether existing coverage meets those requirements.

## Context

You are performing a test-generation-review. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding.

> **Shared perspectives:** Security Auditor is defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

## Scope

**Evaluate changes to:** `src/**`, `lib/**`, `pkg/**`, `app/**`

**Excludes:** Documentation-only changes, configuration files, governance artifacts.

## Perspectives

### Quality Engineer

**Role:** Quality-focused engineer assessing test adequacy.

**Evaluate For:**
- Test coverage completeness
- Test pattern correctness
- Edge case identification
- Test determinism
- Integration boundary coverage

**Principles:**
- Focus on behavior-driven testing
- Prioritize critical path coverage
- Ensure tests are maintainable and deterministic

**Anti-patterns:**
- Testing implementation details
- Over-mocking that hides integration failures
- Ignoring edge cases in critical code paths

### Security Auditor

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Domain Expert

**Role:** Subject matter expert validating business logic coverage.

**Evaluate For:**
- Business rule test coverage
- Acceptance criteria mapping
- Domain edge cases
- Data validation rules

**Principles:**
- Ensure all business rules have corresponding tests
- Verify edge cases specific to the domain
- Validate that test data represents realistic scenarios

**Anti-patterns:**
- Accepting synthetic test data that does not represent real usage patterns
- Ignoring business rule interactions and compound conditions
- Treating acceptance criteria as optional rather than mandatory test targets

## Verification Levels

| Level | When Applied | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | Documentation, config | No test requirements |
| `basic` | Low-risk code (default profile) | Unit tests for modified functions |
| `standard` | Medium-risk or business logic | Unit + integration tests, type checking |
| `strict` | High-risk, financial, PII, infrastructure | Unit + integration + property tests + contract checks |

## Proof-of-Correctness Criteria (Strict Level)

When the `strict` verification level applies, the following proof-of-correctness criteria must be assessed:

- **Type safety:** All public interfaces have explicit type annotations; no implicit `any` or equivalent
- **Property tests:** Invariants are expressed as property-based tests (e.g., round-trip serialization, commutativity, idempotency)
- **Contract checks:** Pre-conditions and post-conditions are validated at module boundaries
- **Invariant proofs:** Critical state invariants are documented and enforced with assertions or runtime checks
- **Integration coverage:** All external integration points have tests covering success, failure, and timeout paths

## Process

1. Classify the code change by risk level and determine the verification level
2. Each participant evaluates coverage requirements from their perspective
3. Map existing tests to required coverage areas and identify gaps
4. Produce structured test requirements with prioritized recommendations

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name
- Verification level assessment
- Required test scenarios
- Coverage gaps identified
- Priority (Critical / High / Medium / Low)

### Consolidated

- Determined verification level
- Required tests by category (unit, integration, property, contract)
- Coverage gap inventory
- Proof-of-correctness assessment (if strict level)
- Prioritized test requirement backlog
- Coverage adequacy verdict (adequate / insufficient / not assessed)

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Confidence score | >= 0.70 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | <= 2 |
| Aggregate verdict | approve |
| Coverage assessment | adequate |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Formula:** `final = base - sum(severity_penalties)`

| Severity | Penalty per finding |
|---|---|
| Base | 0.85 |
| Critical | -0.25 |
| High | -0.15 |
| Medium | -0.05 |
| Low | -0.01 |

The confidence score is floored at 0.0 and capped at 1.0. Each finding's severity contributes its penalty once. If multiple perspectives flag the same gap, count it once at the highest severity.

## Constraints

- Never approve business-critical code without a test coverage assessment
- `fin_pii_high` policy profile: always apply `strict` verification level
- `infrastructure_critical` policy profile: always apply `standard` or higher verification level
- This panel assesses test requirements -- it does not execute tests. Consuming repos run their own test suites.
- Every test requirement must include a specific scenario description and expected behavior
- Distinguish between missing tests (gap) and inadequate tests (quality concern)
