# Review: Threat Model — System-Level

## Purpose

Comprehensive system-level threat model producing a structured security assessment of the entire platform or application. This is an on-demand analysis — not a per-PR gate — that maps the full attack surface to MITRE ATT&CK, performs STRIDE analysis per trust boundary, constructs attack trees, validates detection coverage, and produces a prioritized mitigation roadmap with Sigma detection rules.

## Context

You are performing a **system-level threat model**. Analyze the entire system (or the scope specified by the user) from multiple security perspectives organized into 5 parallel review tracks. Each track has a sub-moderator coordinating its participants. The output must follow the standardized 15-section template exactly, including all appendices.

> **Panel name:** `threat-model-system`
> **Baseline emission:** Uses the same schema as [`threat-modeling.json`](../../emissions/threat-modeling.json) with `panel_name: "threat-model-system"`.

## Review Tracks and Participants

### Track 1: Infrastructure Security
**Sub-Moderator:** Infrastructure Security Engineer

| Participant | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| Systems Architect | Component inventory, data flow diagrams, trust boundaries, external dependencies |
| Infrastructure Engineer | Configuration assessment, IAM scope, network segmentation, encryption, rollback safety |

### Track 2: Supply Chain Security
**Sub-Moderator:** Supply Chain Security Specialist

| Participant | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| MITRE Analyst (ATT&CK) | Trust boundary crossings, threat actor profiles, ATT&CK technique mapping |
| Security Auditor | Dependency audit, third-party risk, SBOM analysis, vulnerability classification |

### Track 3: Application Security
**Sub-Moderator:** Application Security Engineer

| Participant | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| MITRE Analyst (STRIDE) | STRIDE threat catalog per trust boundary, attack tree construction |

---

## Process

### Phase 1: Parallel Analysis
All 5 tracks execute simultaneously. Each sub-moderator coordinates their participants to produce track-specific findings.

### Phase 2: Per-Track Aggregation
Each sub-moderator consolidates their track's findings, resolves contradictions, and produces a track summary.

### Phase 3: Overall Moderator Integration
The overall moderator (you) integrates all 5 track summaries into a unified threat model, cross-referencing findings and eliminating duplicates.

### Phase 4: Hardening Rounds
Iterate on findings where tracks disagree or where additional analysis is needed. Red Team challenges Blue Team detections. Purple Team validates coverage claims.

### Phase 5: Final Report Assembly
Assemble the 15-section output with all Mermaid diagrams, CVSS scores, and Sigma rules.

## Scoring

Confidence score calculation:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base confidence | 0.90 |
| Per critical finding | -0.30 |
| Per high finding | -0.20 |
| Per medium finding | -0.05 |
| Per low finding | -0.01 |
| Floor | 0.0 |

**Formula:** `confidence = max(0.0, 0.90 - (critical * 0.30) - (high * 0.20) - (medium * 0.05) - (low * 0.01))`

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Confidence score | >= 0.75 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | 0 |
| Aggregate verdict | `approve` |
| Compliance score | >= 0.85 |

If **any** criterion fails, the aggregate verdict must be `request_changes`. Critical or high findings indicate unresolved security concerns requiring remediation.

## Data Sensitivity and Redaction

When producing threat model findings, apply these redaction rules:

1. **Never include raw secrets** — API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials discovered during analysis must be redacted. Use `[REDACTED]` placeholder and describe the type of secret (e.g., "AWS access key found in config.py:42")
2. **Redact PII** — Personal identifiable information (emails, names, addresses, SSNs) must be replaced with `[PII-REDACTED]`
3. **Sanitize file paths** — If file paths reveal infrastructure details (server names, internal network paths), generalize them
4. **Describe attack techniques generically** — Reference ATT&CK technique IDs and describe attack vectors at a conceptual level. Do not include working exploit code, payloads, or step-by-step exploitation instructions in the emission
5. **Threat scenarios over exploit recipes** — Threat models should describe *what* an attacker could achieve and *why* it matters, not provide a cookbook for reproducing the attack
6. **Set data_classification** — Include the `data_classification` block in your structured emission:
   - `"public"` — No sensitive content in findings
   - `"internal"` — Contains internal file paths, architecture details
   - `"confidential"` — Contains vulnerability evidence, security configurations, ATT&CK mappings with specific system details
   - `"restricted"` — Contains credential exposure evidence, PII findings, or detailed kill chain analysis of production systems

---

## Execution Trace

To provide evidence of actual code evaluation, include an `execution_trace` object in your structured emission:

- **`files_read`** (required) — List every file you read during this review. Include the full relative path for each file (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`, `infrastructure/main.bicep`). Do not omit files — this is the audit record of what was actually evaluated.
- **`diff_lines_analyzed`** — Count the total number of diff lines (added + removed + modified) you analyzed.
- **`analysis_duration_ms`** — Approximate wall-clock time spent on the analysis in milliseconds.
- **`grounding_references`** — For each finding, link it to a specific code location. Each entry must include `file` (file path) and `finding_id` (matching the finding's persona or a unique identifier). Include `line` (line number) when the finding maps to a specific line.

The `execution_trace` field is optional in the schema but **strongly recommended** for auditability. When present, it provides verifiable evidence that the panel agent actually read and analyzed the code rather than producing a generic assessment.

## Grounding Requirement

**Grounding Requirement**: Every finding with severity 'medium' or above MUST include an `evidence` block containing the file path, line range, and a code snippet (max 200 chars) from the actual code. Findings without evidence may be treated as hallucinated and discarded. If the review produces zero findings, you must still demonstrate analysis by populating `execution_trace.grounding_references` with at least one file+line reference showing what was examined.

## Structured Emission

All output must include a JSON block between emission markers, validated against [`governance/schemas/panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json).

Wrap the JSON in these markers:

```
<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->
{ ... }
<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->
```

## Constraints

- **Every threat must reference a specific ATT&CK technique** — Generic threat descriptions without ATT&CK mapping are incomplete. Use technique IDs (e.g., T1190, T1078) and full names.
- **STRIDE analysis is per trust boundary** — Do not perform a single global STRIDE analysis. Each trust boundary must have its own STRIDE table.
- **Attack trees use OR/AND decomposition** — OR = attacker needs any one child path; AND = attacker needs all child steps. Label nodes clearly.
- **CVSS vectors must be complete** — Use the full CVSS 3.1 vector string. Do not estimate scores without the vector.
- **Sigma rules must be syntactically valid** — Use correct Sigma YAML structure with logsource, detection, and tags.
- **Mermaid diagrams must render** — Test diagram syntax. Use quoted strings for labels with special characters.
- **Distinguish prevention vs detection controls** — A threat with prevention but no detection is a blind spot.
- **Use `N/A — [reason]` for non-applicable sections** — Never omit a section from the template.
- **Treat the threat model as a living document** — Note what should be re-evaluated when the system changes.
