# Review: Technical Debt Review

## Purpose

Assess and prioritize technical debt for strategic remediation. This panel inventories existing and newly introduced debt, evaluates its impact on team velocity and system reliability, and produces a prioritized remediation roadmap based on return on investment.

## Context

You are performing a technical-debt-review. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding.

> **Shared perspectives:** Refactor Specialist, Systems Architect, Test Engineer, Tech Lead are defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).
> **Baseline emission:** [`technical-debt-review.json`](../../emissions/technical-debt-review.json)

## Perspectives

### Refactor Specialist

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Systems Architect

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Test Engineer

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Tech Lead

See [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md) for the canonical definition.

### Minimalist Engineer

**Role:** Engineer focused on aggressive simplification.

**Evaluate For:**
- Unnecessary abstraction
- Premature optimization
- Framework overuse
- Redundant layers

**Principles:**
- Prefer deletion over modification
- Question every abstraction layer
- Value YAGNI over future-proofing

**Anti-patterns:**
- Adding abstraction without clear immediate justification
- Introducing frameworks when simple code suffices
- Preserving dead code out of caution

## Process

1. Inventory known technical debt in the affected area
2. Each participant identifies debt items from their perspective
3. Assess impact of each debt item on velocity and reliability
4. Estimate remediation effort for each item
5. Prioritize by return on investment (impact / effort)

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name
- Debt items identified
- Impact assessment (velocity, reliability, security, maintainability)
- Remediation approach (delete, refactor, rewrite, accept with monitoring)

### Consolidated

- Debt inventory with categories (code debt, architectural debt, test debt, documentation debt, dependency debt)
- High-impact items (debt that is actively degrading velocity or reliability)
- Quick wins (low-effort remediations with meaningful improvement)
- Strategic debt (debt accepted deliberately with monitoring plan)
- Recommended roadmap (prioritized by ROI with effort estimates)

| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | <= 3 |
| Aggregate verdict | request_changes |
| Compliance score | >= 0.60 |

## Confidence Score Calculation

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base confidence | 0.85 |
| Per critical finding | -0.25 |
| Per high finding | -0.15 |
| Per medium finding | -0.05 |
| Per low finding | -0.01 |
| Floor | 0.0 |
| Cap | 1.0 |

## Execution Trace

To provide evidence of actual code evaluation, include an `execution_trace` object in your structured emission:

- **`files_read`** (required) — List every file you read during this review. Include the full relative path for each file (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`, `infrastructure/main.bicep`). Do not omit files — this is the audit record of what was actually evaluated.
- **`diff_lines_analyzed`** — Count the total number of diff lines (added + removed + modified) you analyzed.
- **`analysis_duration_ms`** — Approximate wall-clock time spent on the analysis in milliseconds.
- **`grounding_references`** — For each finding, link it to a specific code location. Each entry must include `file` (file path) and `finding_id` (matching the finding's persona or a unique identifier). Include `line` (line number) when the finding maps to a specific line.

The `execution_trace` field is optional in the schema but **strongly recommended** for auditability. When present, it provides verifiable evidence that the panel agent actually read and analyzed the code rather than producing a generic assessment.

## Grounding Requirement

**Grounding Requirement**: Every finding with severity 'medium' or above MUST include an `evidence` block containing the file path, line range, and a code snippet (max 200 chars) from the actual code. Findings without evidence may be treated as hallucinated and discarded. If the review produces zero findings, you must still demonstrate analysis by populating `execution_trace.grounding_references` with at least one file+line reference showing what was examined.

Each finding's severity contributes its penalty once. If multiple perspectives flag the same issue, count it once at the highest severity. The score is floored at 0.0 and capped at 1.0.
## Constraints

- Quantify impact wherever possible -- use metrics such as velocity trends, incident frequency, or time-to-change estimates
- Consider compounding effects of debt -- small items that interact may produce outsized drag
- Balance remediation effort against feature delivery -- do not recommend wholesale rewrites when incremental improvement is viable
- Identify debt that is blocking planned future work and flag it as high priority
- Distinguish between deliberate strategic debt (accepted with monitoring) and accidental debt (unintentional degradation)
- Every debt item must include an estimated effort category (hours, days, sprint) and expected benefit
