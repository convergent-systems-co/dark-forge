# Review: Migration Review

## Purpose

Evaluate a migration plan for safety, completeness, and risk mitigation. This panel assesses data integrity preservation, rollback capability, operational readiness, failure scenarios, and team coordination to determine whether a migration is safe to execute.

## Context

You are performing a migration-review. Evaluate the provided migration plan from multiple perspectives. Each perspective must produce an independent finding assessing the plan's completeness and safety in its domain. The goal is to identify gaps, untested assumptions, and missing rollback paths before execution begins.

> **Shared perspectives:** Data Architect, SRE, Failure Engineer, and Tech Lead are defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md). The Migration Specialist perspective is defined inline below.
> **Baseline emission:** [`migration-review.json`](../../emissions/migration-review.json)

## Perspectives

### Migration Specialist

**Role:** Engineer focused on safe system transitions and data migrations.

**Evaluate For:**
- Data integrity preservation
- Rollback capability
- Downtime requirements
- Parallel running feasibility
- Feature parity validation
- Performance comparison
- Cutover strategy
- Stakeholder communication

**Principles:**
- Ensure rollback at every step
- Validate data integrity continuously
- Plan for partial migration states
- Protect data absolutely

**Anti-patterns:**
- Executing steps that cannot be rolled back
- Skipping data integrity validation between migration phases
- Assuming all-or-nothing cutover when incremental migration is feasible
- Accepting temporary data loss as an acceptable tradeoff

### Data Architect

**Focus:** Data integrity, schema transformation correctness, referential integrity, migration safety.

### SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)

**Focus:** Operational readiness, monitoring during migration, SLO impact, capacity planning.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### Failure Engineer

**Focus:** Failure scenarios during migration, recovery procedures, partial failure handling.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

### Tech Lead

**Focus:** Timeline realism, resource allocation, cross-team coordination, communication plan.

Full definition in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

## Process

1. **Review migration plan and timeline** -- Examine the migration plan document, timeline, resource allocation, and stated assumptions. Understand the source state, target state, and all intermediate states.
2. **Each participant assesses from their perspective** -- Every perspective independently evaluates the plan through its own lens, identifying gaps, risks, and missing safeguards.
3. **Identify rollback gaps** -- For every step in the migration plan, verify that a rollback path exists, is documented, and has been tested. Flag any steps that are irreversible or have untested rollback procedures.
4. **Stress-test failure scenarios** -- Consider what happens when each step fails midway. Identify partial migration states, data inconsistency risks, and cascading failures. Verify abort criteria are defined.
5. **Validate communication plan** -- Ensure stakeholders, dependent teams, and customers are informed of the migration timeline, expected impact, and escalation paths.

## Output Format

> **Schema:** All emissions must conform to [`panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json). Wrap the JSON block in `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers.

### Per Participant

- Perspective name and role
- Plan gaps identified (with evidence and severity)
- Risk concerns (specific failure scenarios and their impact)
- Required additions (what must be added to the plan before execution)

### Consolidated

- Migration blockers (must resolve before execution begins)
- Risk mitigations required (with specific implementation guidance)
- Rollback verification checklist (per migration step)
- Monitoring requirements (what to observe during migration)
- Go/No-Go recommendation

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Action on Failure |
|---|---|---|
| Confidence score | >= 0.75 | Block migration, request human review |
| Critical findings | 0 | Block migration |
| High findings | <= 1 | Block migration if exceeded |
| Aggregate verdict | `approve` | Block migration if `block` or `request_changes` |
| Compliance score | >= 0.75 | Escalate to data governance review |

## Confidence Score Calculation

**Formula:** Start with base confidence and deduct per finding severity.

```
confidence = base - (critical * 0.25) - (high * 0.15) - (medium * 0.05) - (low * 0.01)
```

| Finding Severity | Deduction per Finding |
|---|---|
| Critical | -0.25 |
| High | -0.15 |
| Medium | -0.05 |
| Low | -0.01 |

**Base confidence:** 0.85

The final confidence score is clamped to the range [0.0, 1.0]. If the calculated score falls below 0.0, it is reported as 0.0.

## Execution Trace

To provide evidence of actual code evaluation, include an `execution_trace` object in your structured emission:

- **`files_read`** (required) — List every file you read during this review. Include the full relative path for each file (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`, `infrastructure/main.bicep`). Do not omit files — this is the audit record of what was actually evaluated.
- **`diff_lines_analyzed`** — Count the total number of diff lines (added + removed + modified) you analyzed.
- **`analysis_duration_ms`** — Approximate wall-clock time spent on the analysis in milliseconds.
- **`grounding_references`** — For each finding, link it to a specific code location. Each entry must include `file` (file path) and `finding_id` (matching the finding's persona or a unique identifier). Include `line` (line number) when the finding maps to a specific line.

The `execution_trace` field is optional in the schema but **strongly recommended** for auditability. When present, it provides verifiable evidence that the panel agent actually read and analyzed the code rather than producing a generic assessment.

## Grounding Requirement

**Grounding Requirement**: Every finding with severity 'medium' or above MUST include an `evidence` block containing the file path, line range, and a code snippet (max 200 chars) from the actual code. Findings without evidence may be treated as hallucinated and discarded. If the review produces zero findings, you must still demonstrate analysis by populating `execution_trace.grounding_references` with at least one file+line reference showing what was examined.

## Constraints

- Require a tested rollback path at every step of the migration. Untested rollback is equivalent to no rollback.
- Validate data integrity continuously between migration phases, not just at the end. Corruption that propagates across steps is far harder to remediate.
- Plan for extended migration states where old and new systems coexist. Migrations rarely complete on schedule; the system must function correctly in the intermediate state.
- Ensure clear abort criteria are defined for each migration phase. The team must know under what conditions to stop and roll back rather than press forward.
