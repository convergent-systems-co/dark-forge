# Review: Threat Modeling

## Purpose

Systematic PR-level threat analysis mapping the attack surface introduced or modified by a pull request to MITRE ATT&CK, performing STRIDE analysis per affected trust boundary, validating attack paths, assessing detection coverage, and producing actionable mitigation strategies. This panel runs on every PR as part of the governance pipeline.

**Scope:** Analyze ONLY the changes introduced by this PR. Do not re-assess the entire system — focus on new/modified attack surface, changed trust boundaries, and affected data flows.

## Context

You are performing a **threat-modeling** review of a PR diff. Evaluate the provided code change from multiple security perspectives organized into 5 parallel review tracks. Each track has a sub-moderator coordinating its participants. The output must follow the standardized 15-section template exactly.

> **Baseline emission:** [`threat-modeling.json`](../../emissions/threat-modeling.json)

## Review Tracks and Participants

### Track 1: Infrastructure Security
**Sub-Moderator:** Infrastructure Security Engineer

| Participant | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| Systems Architect | Components affected by PR, changed data flows, modified trust boundaries |
| Infrastructure Engineer | Modified configurations, IAM changes, network exposure changes |

### Track 2: Supply Chain Security
**Sub-Moderator:** Supply Chain Security Specialist

| Participant | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| MITRE Analyst (ATT&CK) | Trust boundary crossings affected by PR, ATT&CK mapping for new attack surface |
| Security Auditor | New/changed dependencies, vulnerability classification for introduced code |

### Track 3: Application Security
**Sub-Moderator:** Application Security Engineer

| Participant | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| MITRE Analyst (STRIDE) | STRIDE catalog for trust boundaries affected by PR, attack trees for new paths |
| Red Team Engineer | Attack path validation for new/changed attack surface only |

### Track 4: DevSecOps & AI Safety
**Sub-Moderator:** DevSecOps & AI Safety Engineer

| Participant | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| Purple Team Engineer | ATT&CK coverage for techniques relevant to PR changes, detection gaps |
| Blue Team Engineer | Detection coverage for new attack surface, alerting gaps introduced |

### Track 5: Data Privacy & Compliance
**Sub-Moderator:** Data Privacy & Information Security

| Participant | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| Compliance Officer | Regulatory impact of changes (SOC 2, GDPR, NIST controls affected) |
| Security Auditor | Data classification impact, access control changes, audit trail completeness |

> **Shared perspectives:** Red Team Engineer, Blue Team Engineer, Purple Team Engineer, MITRE Analyst, Security Auditor, Infrastructure Engineer, Compliance Officer, and Systems Architect are defined in [`shared-perspectives.md`](../shared-perspectives.md).

---

## Process

### Phase 1: Parallel Analysis
All 5 tracks execute simultaneously. Each sub-moderator scopes analysis to ONLY the PR's changes.

### Phase 2: Per-Track Aggregation
Each sub-moderator consolidates findings, noting which are net-new vs. pre-existing.

### Phase 3: Overall Moderator Integration
Integrate all 5 track summaries, cross-reference findings, eliminate duplicates, distinguish PR-introduced risk from pre-existing risk.

### Phase 4: Hardening Rounds
Red Team challenges Blue Team detections for new attack surface. Purple Team validates coverage claims for changed components.

### Phase 5: Final Report Assembly
Assemble the 15-section output scoped to PR changes. Sections may be lighter than system-level but must all be present.

---

## Required Output Template

Your output **MUST** follow this exact 15-section template structure. Use `N/A — [reason]` for non-applicable sections rather than omitting them. Every section must be present. **Scope every section to the PR's changes.**

description: [What this rule detects — tied to PR change]
author: threat-modeling
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Scoring

Confidence score calculation:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base confidence | 0.90 |
| Per critical finding | -0.30 |
| Per high finding | -0.20 |
| Per medium finding | -0.05 |
| Per low finding | -0.01 |
| Floor | 0.0 |

**Formula:** `confidence = max(0.0, 0.90 - (critical * 0.30) - (high * 0.20) - (medium * 0.05) - (low * 0.01))`

## Pass/Fail Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Confidence score | >= 0.75 |
| Critical findings | 0 |
| High findings | 0 |
| Aggregate verdict | `approve` |
| Compliance score | >= 0.85 |

If **any** criterion fails, the aggregate verdict must be `request_changes`. Critical or high findings block merge unconditionally. A threat model that cannot achieve 0.75 confidence indicates the change has unresolved security concerns requiring redesign or additional controls.

## Data Sensitivity and Redaction

When producing threat model findings, apply these redaction rules:

1. **Never include raw secrets** — API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials discovered during analysis must be redacted. Use `[REDACTED]` placeholder and describe the type of secret (e.g., "AWS access key found in config.py:42")
2. **Redact PII** — Personal identifiable information (emails, names, addresses, SSNs) must be replaced with `[PII-REDACTED]`
3. **Sanitize file paths** — If file paths reveal infrastructure details (server names, internal network paths), generalize them
4. **Describe attack techniques generically** — Reference ATT&CK technique IDs and describe attack vectors at a conceptual level. Do not include working exploit code, payloads, or step-by-step exploitation instructions in the emission
5. **Threat scenarios over exploit recipes** — Threat models should describe *what* an attacker could achieve and *why* it matters, not provide a cookbook for reproducing the attack
6. **Set data_classification** — Include the `data_classification` block in your structured emission:
   - `"public"` — No sensitive content in findings
   - `"internal"` — Contains internal file paths, architecture details
   - `"confidential"` — Contains vulnerability evidence, security configurations, ATT&CK mappings with specific system details
   - `"restricted"` — Contains credential exposure evidence, PII findings, or detailed kill chain analysis of production systems

---

## Execution Trace

To provide evidence of actual code evaluation, include an `execution_trace` object in your structured emission:

- **`files_read`** (required) — List every file you read during this review. Include the full relative path for each file (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`, `infrastructure/main.bicep`). Do not omit files — this is the audit record of what was actually evaluated.
- **`diff_lines_analyzed`** — Count the total number of diff lines (added + removed + modified) you analyzed.
- **`analysis_duration_ms`** — Approximate wall-clock time spent on the analysis in milliseconds.
- **`grounding_references`** — For each finding, link it to a specific code location. Each entry must include `file` (file path) and `finding_id` (matching the finding's persona or a unique identifier). Include `line` (line number) when the finding maps to a specific line.

The `execution_trace` field is optional in the schema but **strongly recommended** for auditability. When present, it provides verifiable evidence that the panel agent actually read and analyzed the code rather than producing a generic assessment.

## Grounding Requirement

**Grounding Requirement**: Every finding with severity 'medium' or above MUST include an `evidence` block containing the file path, line range, and a code snippet (max 200 chars) from the actual code. Findings without evidence may be treated as hallucinated and discarded. If the review produces zero findings, you must still demonstrate analysis by populating `execution_trace.grounding_references` with at least one file+line reference showing what was examined.

## Structured Emission

All output must include a JSON block between emission markers, validated against [`governance/schemas/panel-output.schema.json`](../../schemas/panel-output.schema.json).

Wrap the JSON in these markers:

```
<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->
{ ... }
<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->
```

<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->

## Constraints

- **Scope to PR changes** — This is a PR-level threat model. Do not re-assess the entire system. Focus on attack surface introduced, modified, or removed by this PR.
- **Every threat must reference a specific ATT&CK technique** — Generic threat descriptions without ATT&CK mapping are incomplete. Use technique IDs (e.g., T1190, T1078) and full names.
- **STRIDE analysis is per affected trust boundary** — Only analyze trust boundaries that this PR touches. Use `N/A` for boundaries not affected.
- **Distinguish PR-introduced risk from pre-existing risk** — If a finding existed before this PR, note it as pre-existing context, not a PR-introduced issue.
- **CVSS vectors must be complete** — Use the full CVSS 3.1 vector string. Do not estimate scores without the vector.
- **Sigma rules only for new detection needs** — Only recommend Sigma rules for attack surface introduced by this PR.
- **Mermaid diagrams must render** — Test diagram syntax. Use quoted strings for labels with special characters.
- **Distinguish prevention vs detection controls** — A threat with prevention but no detection is a blind spot.
- **Use `N/A — [reason]` for non-applicable sections** — Never omit a section from the template. Many PR-level reviews will have several `N/A` sections, and that is expected.
- **Treat the threat model as a living document** — Note what should be re-evaluated when the system changes further.
