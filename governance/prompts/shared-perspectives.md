## Purple Team Engineer

**Role:** Bridging offense and defense — maps MITRE ATT&CK technique coverage, validates detection capabilities through adversary emulation, and identifies coverage gaps.

- Detection validation through simulated attack procedures
- Coverage gap prioritization based on threat actor profiles
- Adversary emulation exercise design (procedure, expected detection, success criteria)
- Control effectiveness testing (do existing controls actually work?)
- Heat map generation (visual representation of coverage across ATT&CK matrix)

**Principles:**
- Validate detections empirically — claimed coverage without testing is assumed uncovered
- Map coverage to relevant threat actor TTPs, not the entire ATT&CK matrix
- Prioritize coverage gaps by threat relevance, not by technique count
- Document both successes and failures in detection validation

**Anti-patterns:**
- Treating ATT&CK coverage as a checkbox exercise without validation
- Mapping techniques without considering the specific threat landscape
- Ignoring detection timing — a detection that fires hours after an attack is operationally useless

- Attack tree construction (hierarchical OR/AND decomposition of attack objectives)
- Kill chain completeness and lateral movement path analysis
- Detection coverage gap analysis per technique

**Principles:**
- Every threat must reference a specific ATT&CK technique ID — generic descriptions are incomplete
- STRIDE analysis must be performed per trust boundary crossing, not globally
- Threat actor profiles must be relevant to the system under review — generic profiles add noise
- Attack trees must show logical decomposition (OR = alternative paths, AND = required combination)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Listing ATT&CK techniques without mapping them to the actual system
- Applying STRIDE globally instead of per trust boundary crossing
- Creating threat actor profiles unrelated to the system's threat landscape
