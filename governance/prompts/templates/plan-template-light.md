# Lightweight Plan Template

Use this template for fast-track changes: documentation updates, typo fixes, chores, and test-only changes. For non-trivial changes, use the full `plan-template.md` instead.

Plans must be saved to `governance/plans/` (ai-submodule) or `.governance/plans/` (consuming repos).

## When to Use This Template

- Documentation-only changes (README, guides, inline comments)
- Typo and formatting fixes
- Chore tasks (dependency bumps, config cleanup, CI tweaks)
- Test-only additions or fixes

If the change touches application source code, infrastructure, APIs, or security-sensitive paths, use the full `plan-template.md`.

## Governance

Fast-track changes use the `fast-track` policy profile with reduced panel requirements. Security-review is always required regardless of change type.
