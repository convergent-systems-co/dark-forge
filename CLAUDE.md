# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repository Is

This is the **Dark Factory Governance Platform** — an AI governance framework for autonomous software delivery, distributed as a git submodule to consuming repositories. It contains no application source code; it is entirely configuration, policy, schemas, and documentation.

Current maturity: **Phase 4b (Autonomous Remediation)** — all governance artifacts implemented. Phase 5 sub-phases (5a-5e) are defined with achievability assessments; 5a (self-proving systems), 5b (self-evolution), 5c (always-on orchestration), and 5e (spec-driven interface) governance artifacts are complete.

## Repository Commands

There is no build system, test runner, or linter. This is a configuration-only repo.

**Bootstrap (for consuming repos):**
```bash
bash .ai/bin/init.sh                    # Symlinks only
bash .ai/bin/init.sh --install-deps     # Symlinks + Python venv + dependencies
```
Checks `.ai` submodule freshness (auto-updates if behind), creates symlinks for CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, and .github/copilot-instructions.md, creates `.plans/` and `.panels/` directories, generates GOALS.md from template, and validates required panel emissions.

**Agentic bootstrap (interactive):**
Tell your AI assistant to read and execute `governance/prompts/init.md`. This walks through setup interactively — choosing a language template, configuring repository settings, and installing dependencies — with the agent asking about each option.

**Submodule operations (from consuming repo):**
```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:SET-Apps/ai-submodule.git .ai
git submodule update --remote .ai
```

## Architecture

### Five Governance Layers

Every code change flows through these layers in order:

1. **Intent** — Design Intent intake, completeness validation, risk classification
2. **Cognitive** — Persona-based reasoning via multi-persona panels producing structured emissions
3. **Execution** — Deterministic policy engine evaluates panel emissions, produces merge decisions
4. **Runtime** (Phase 5) — Drift detection, incident-to-DI generation
5. **Evolution** (Phase 5) — Self-improvement loops with backward compatibility checks

### Three Artifact Types

| Type | Format | Purpose | Mutability |
|------|--------|---------|------------|
| **Cognitive** | Markdown | Personas, prompts, workflows — interpreted by AI | Editable |
| **Enforcement** | JSON Schema / YAML | Policies, schemas — evaluated programmatically, never by AI | Versioned |
| **Audit** | JSON + Markdown | Run manifests — immutable decision records | Append-only |

### Persona and Panel System

- **Consolidated review prompts** (`governance/prompts/reviews/`) — 19 self-contained review prompts implementing Anthropic's Parallelization (Voting) pattern. Each prompt inlines its participant perspectives with full evaluation criteria, scoring, and output schema. This is the primary location for review definitions.
- **Shared perspectives** (`governance/prompts/shared-perspectives.md`) — Canonical definitions for the 19 perspectives appearing in 2+ review prompts. Serves as the authoring-time DRY mechanism; compiled prompts have full locality at runtime.
- **Personas** (`governance/personas/`) — _Deprecated._ 58 role definitions across 13 categories. Superseded by consolidated review prompts. Will be removed in a future release.
- **Panels** (`governance/personas/panels/`) — _Deprecated._ 19 multi-persona review workflows. Superseded by consolidated review prompts. Will be removed in a future release.
- **Agentic personas** (`governance/personas/agentic/`) — Four-agent prompt-chained architecture:
  - **DevOps Engineer** — Session entry point: pre-flight, triage, routing (Anthropic's Routing pattern)
  - **Code Manager** — Pipeline orchestrator: intent validation, panel selection, review coordination, merge (Orchestrator-Workers pattern)
  - **Coder** — Execution agent: implementation, tests, documentation (Worker)
  - **Tester** — Independent evaluator: test coverage gate, documentation verification, structured feedback (Evaluator-Optimizer pattern)
- **Agent protocol** (`governance/prompts/agent-protocol.md`) — Structured inter-agent communication with typed messages: ASSIGN, STATUS, RESULT, FEEDBACK, ESCALATE, APPROVE, BLOCK

> See `docs/research/README.md` for the research supporting the persona consolidation decision (Issue #220).

### Policy Engine

Four deterministic YAML profiles in `governance/policy/`:
- `default.yaml` — Standard risk tolerance, auto-merge enabled with conditions
- `fin_pii_high.yaml` — SOC2/PCI-DSS/HIPAA/GDPR, auto-merge disabled, 3-approver override
- `infrastructure_critical.yaml` — Mandatory architecture and SRE review
- `reduced_touchpoint.yaml` — Near-full autonomy, human approval only for policy overrides and dismissed security-critical findings (Phase 5e)

All profiles require security-review, threat-modeling, cost-analysis, documentation-review, and data-governance-review panels on every PR. Policies are evaluated programmatically. AI models never interpret policy rules.

### Context Management (JIT Loading)

Context is loaded in tiers to prevent window overflow:
- **Tier 0** (~400 tokens, survives resets): `instructions.md` + project identity
- **Tier 1** (~2,000 tokens, session): Language conventions + active personas
- **Tier 2** (~3,000 tokens, per-phase): Workflow phase + panel context
- **Tier 3** (0 tokens, on-demand): Policies, schemas, docs — queried only when needed

**Hard stop at 80% context capacity.** When approaching this limit: stop all work, clean git state, write a checkpoint to `.checkpoints/`, report to user, and request `/clear`. Never allow context to compact with dirty state. See `docs/architecture/context-management.md` for the full shutdown protocol.

### Structured Emissions

All panel output must include JSON between `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_START -->` and `<!-- STRUCTURED_EMISSION_END -->` markers, validated against `governance/schemas/panel-output.schema.json`. Missing markers or invalid JSON means panel execution failed.

## Key Conventions

- **Commit style**: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`)
- **Branch naming**: `itsfwcp/{issue-type}/{issue-number}/{branch-name}` (e.g., `itsfwcp/feat/42/add-auth`)
- **Plans before code**: Every implementation requires a plan in `.plans/` using `governance/prompts/templates/plan-template.md`
- **Governance pipeline is mandatory**: The governance pipeline applies in all modes (local and remote). Required panels must execute, plan-first is non-negotiable, and the CI workflow blocks merges when panel emissions are missing. Projects can opt out via `governance.skip_panel_validation: true` in `project.yaml` (project root).
- **`jm-compliance.yml` is enterprise-locked**: Never modify, move, or override `jm-compliance.yml`. It is managed centrally.
- **Backward compatibility**: All changes must be additive. Breaking changes require migration plans and version bumps.
- **Enforcement artifacts use semantic versioning** in their `profile_version` or `version` field
- **Cognitive artifacts version by git SHA** — they evolve with the submodule
- **Manifests are immutable** — never edit after creation

## Agentic Startup Sequence

When operating autonomously (via `governance/prompts/startup.md`), the pipeline chains four personas through five phases:

| Phase | Persona | What Happens |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | DevOps Engineer | Pre-flight (submodule, repo config — respects `project.yaml` pin), resolve open PRs, triage and route issues |
| 2 | Code Manager | Validate intent, select context-appropriate review panels, create plan |
| 3 | Coder | Implement plan, write tests, update documentation |
| 4 | Code Manager + Tester | Tester evaluates → Security review → Context-specific reviews → PR monitoring loop |
| 5 | Code Manager + DevOps Engineer | Merge, retrospective, mandatory checkpoint |

Max 3 issues per session; **hard stop at 80% context capacity** — executes shutdown protocol (clean git, write checkpoint, request `/clear`)

## Symlink Configuration

`config.yaml` defines symlinks created by `init.sh` for consuming repos:
- `instructions.md` → `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

This ensures Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor all receive the same base instructions in consuming projects.

## Project Directories

`init.sh` creates these directories in consuming repos (not in the submodule):
- `.plans/` — Implementation plans for issues and features (accumulated)
- `.panels/` — Panel review reports (latest only per panel type, overwrite strategy)
- `.governance-state/` — Cross-session governance state persistence (accumulated)

Directories are configured in `config.yaml` under `project_directories` and can be extended in `project.yaml` (project root).
