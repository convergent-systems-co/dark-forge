# .ai — Dark Factory Governance Platform

AI governance framework for autonomous software delivery. Provides personas, panels, policy enforcement, structured emissions, and audit manifests — distributed as a git submodule to any repository.

> **New here?** See the [Developer Quick Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for a TLDR onboarding.

## Goals

The Dark Factory Governance Platform exists to:

1. **Automate software delivery governance** — Replace manual code review gates with structured, auditable AI-driven review panels that produce deterministic merge decisions.
2. **Enforce policy without human bottlenecks** — Deterministic policy profiles (default, financial/PII, infrastructure-critical) evaluate every change programmatically. AI models never interpret policy rules.
3. **Maintain compliance at scale** — Embed SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance into the review pipeline so regulated changes are caught at intake, not after merge.
4. **Enable autonomous agentic operation** — A 4-agent prompt-chained pipeline (DevOps Engineer → Code Manager → Coder → Tester) orchestrates the full lifecycle (session management, issue triage, planning, implementation, evaluation, review, merge) with human oversight only where policy requires it.
5. **Distribute governance as infrastructure** — Ship as a git submodule so any repository gets personas, panels, policies, and CI workflows by adding a single dependency.
6. **Reach full Dark Factory** — Progress through defined maturity phases toward fully autonomous software delivery with runtime feedback loops and self-evolving governance.

See [GOALS.md](GOALS.md) for detailed phase tracking, completed work, and open enhancements.

## Governance Maturity Model

| Phase | Name | Description | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 3 | Agentic Orchestration | Personas, panels, workflows with human gates | Implemented |
| 4a | Policy-Bound Autonomy | Deterministic merge decisions, structured emissions | **Implemented** — CI enforcement live |
| 4b | Autonomous Remediation | Auto-fix, drift detection, remediation loops | **Implemented** — drift detection, auto-remediation, and incident-to-DI governance artifacts complete |
| 5 | Dark Factory | Full automation — decomposed into sub-phases 5a-5e with achievability assessment | 5a-5e governance artifacts complete; 5c and 5d runtime blocked by platform (session-based tooling, no multi-agent orchestrator) |

## How It Works

### Agentic Pipeline (4-Agent Prompt Chain)

The platform uses a 4-agent prompt-chained pipeline implementing Anthropic's orchestration patterns:

| Agent | Pattern | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| **DevOps Engineer** | Routing | Session entry, pre-flight checks, issue triage, routing |
| **Code Manager** | Orchestrator-Workers | Intent validation, panel selection, review coordination, merge |
| **Coder** | Worker | Implementation, test coverage, structured output |
| **Tester** | Evaluator-Optimizer | Independent evaluation, test verification, structured feedback |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Issue] --> B[DevOps Engineer<br/>Routing]
    B --> C[Code Manager<br/>Orchestrator]
    C --> D[Coder<br/>Worker]
    D --> E[Tester<br/>Evaluator]
    E -->|Feedback| D
    E -->|Approve| F[Security Review]
    F --> G[Context Reviews]
    G --> H[Policy Engine]
    H --> I[Merge / Block]
```

Inter-agent communication uses typed messages (`ASSIGN`, `STATUS`, `RESULT`, `FEEDBACK`, `ESCALATE`, `APPROVE`, `BLOCK`) per the [Agent Protocol](governance/prompts/agent-protocol.md).

### Governance Layers (Phase 4a)

```
Issue / Design Intent
        |
        v
Code Manager validates intent (Layer 1: Intent Governance)
        |
        v
Panel graph activated (Layer 2: Cognitive Governance)
  - Code Manager selects panels based on codebase type and change
  - Panels execute in parallel where possible
        |
        v
Panels emit structured JSON (Layer 3: Execution Governance)
  - Confidence scores, risk levels, policy flags
  - Validated against governance/schemas/panel-output.schema.json
        |
        v
Policy engine evaluates (deterministic, no prose)
  - Reads active policy profile (default, fin_pii_high, infrastructure_critical, reduced_touchpoint)
  - Produces decision: auto_merge | auto_remediate | human_review_required | block
        |
        v
Run manifest logged (governance/schemas/run-manifest.schema.json)
  - Complete audit trail for replay and compliance
```

### For Runtime Feedback (Phase 5 — Designed)

```
Runtime anomaly detected
        |
        v
Signal classified and deduplicated
        |
        v
Design Intent generated automatically
        |
        v
Feeds back into Layer 1 (closes the autonomous loop)
```

## Compliance and Security

Security, regulatory compliance, and code quality are embedded at every governance layer:

| Layer | Compliance Mechanism |
|-------|---------------------|
| Intent | Risk classification at intake; PII/financial flags trigger `fin_pii_high` profile |
| Cognitive | Security Auditor and Compliance Officer personas activated for regulated changes |
| Execution | Policy engine enforces compliance scores, blocks PII exposure, requires security panel |
| Runtime | Drift detection monitors compliance regression; incidents generate remediation DIs |
| Evolution | Backward compatibility checks; breaking changes require migration plans |

Policy profiles provide pre-configured compliance postures:
- **`fin_pii_high`** — SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR. Auto-merge disabled. 3-approver override.
- **`infrastructure_critical`** — Production stability. Mandatory architecture and SRE review.
- **`default`** — Standard internal applications. Balanced automation and oversight.
- **`reduced_touchpoint`** — Near-full autonomy. Human approval only for policy overrides, dismissed security-critical findings, or critical risk. Phase 5e.

## Context Management

The framework uses JIT (Just-In-Time) loading to minimize AI context window usage:

| Tier | Content | Budget | Survives Reset |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|
| 0 | Base instructions + project identity | ~400 tokens | Yes (pinned) |
| 1 | Language conventions + active personas | ~2,000 tokens | Session duration |
| 2 | Current workflow phase + panel context | ~3,000 tokens | Released per phase |
| 3 | Policies, schemas, docs | 0 tokens | Queried on-demand |

See `docs/architecture/context-management.md` for the full strategy including checkpoint-based reset protection and instruction decomposition.

## Repo Rename Recommendation

This repository is currently named `ai-submodule`. Given its evolution into a governance platform, a more descriptive name is recommended:

| Candidate | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **`dark-factory`** | Aligns with the governance model name and Phase 5 goal |
| **`ai-governance`** | Descriptive of current function |
| **`forge`** | Short, evocative of autonomous manufacturing |

The rename should be coordinated across all consuming repositories that reference the submodule URL.

## Why a Git Submodule?

| Approach | Drawback |
|----------|----------|
| Copy-paste | Drifts immediately. No propagation across repos. |
| Package manager | Runtime dependency for static text. Overkill. |
| Monorepo | Forces all projects into one repo. |
| Template repo | One-time only. Updates don't flow. |
| Git subtree | Merges history into host repo. Hard to update cleanly. |

Submodules provide version-pinned, single-source-of-truth distribution with no toolchain requirement.

## Usage

### Adding to a Project

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:SET-Apps/ai-submodule.git .ai
git commit -m "Add .ai submodule"
```

### Bootstrap (after adding submodule)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
bash .ai/bin/init.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .ai\bin\init.ps1
```

The bootstrap script creates symlinks so Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor all receive shared instructions. On Windows, if symlinks are unavailable (requires Developer Mode or admin), it falls back to file copies.

**Windows prerequisites:**
- **Python 3.12+** — required for the governance policy engine. Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it's in your PATH.
- After installing Python: `pip install jsonschema pyyaml`

### Cloning with Submodule

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <PROJECT_URL>
```

### Updating

```bash
git submodule update --remote .ai
git add .ai
git commit -m "Update .ai submodule"
```

### Pinning a Version

```bash
cd .ai
git checkout v2.0.0
cd ..
git add .ai
git commit -m "Pin .ai submodule to v2.0.0"
```

### Project-Specific Configuration

> **Agentic mode:** The Code Manager auto-detects your repository's languages, frameworks, and infrastructure, and creates or updates `project.yaml` automatically. Manual setup is only needed if you want to customize before the first agentic session.

1. Copy a language template: `cp .ai/governance/templates/python/project.yaml project.yaml`
2. Customize personas, panels, and conventions
3. Set the governance policy profile:
   ```yaml
   governance:
     policy_profile: default
   ```

### Removing

```bash
git submodule deinit -f .ai
git rm -f .ai
rm -rf .git/modules/.ai
git commit -m "Remove .ai submodule"
```
