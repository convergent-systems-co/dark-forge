# .ai — Dark Factory Governance Platform

AI governance framework for autonomous software delivery. Provides personas, panels, policy enforcement, structured emissions, and audit manifests — distributed as a git submodule to any repository.

> **[Documentation Site](https://set-apps.github.io/ai-submodule)** — Full documentation, tutorials, and architecture guides.

> **New here?** Start with the [Simple Explainer](docs/onboarding/eli5.md) (plain-language overview) or jump straight to the [Developer Quick Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for a TLDR onboarding.

## Goals

The Dark Factory Governance Platform exists to:

1. **Automate software delivery governance** — Replace manual code review gates with structured, auditable AI-driven review panels that produce deterministic merge decisions.
2. **Enforce policy without human bottlenecks** — Deterministic policy profiles (default, financial/PII, infrastructure-critical) evaluate every change programmatically. AI models never interpret policy rules.
3. **Maintain compliance at scale** — Embed SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance into the review pipeline so regulated changes are caught at intake, not after merge.
4. **Enable autonomous agentic operation** — A 6-agent prompt-chained pipeline (Project Manager, DevOps Engineer, Code Manager, Coder, IaC Engineer, Tester) orchestrates the full lifecycle (session management, issue triage, planning, implementation, evaluation, review, merge) with human oversight only where policy requires it.
5. **Distribute governance as infrastructure** — Ship as a git submodule so any repository gets personas, panels, policies, and CI workflows by adding a single dependency.
6. **Reach full Dark Factory** — Progress through defined maturity phases toward fully autonomous software delivery with runtime feedback loops and self-evolving governance.

## Governance Maturity Model

| Phase | Name | Description | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 3 | Agentic Orchestration | Personas, panels, workflows with human gates | Implemented |
| 4a | Policy-Bound Autonomy | Deterministic merge decisions, structured emissions | **Implemented** — CI enforcement live |
| 4b | Autonomous Remediation | Auto-fix, drift detection, remediation loops | **Implemented** — drift detection, auto-remediation, and incident-to-DI governance artifacts complete |
| 5 | Dark Factory | Full automation — decomposed into sub-phases 5a-5e with achievability assessment | 5a-5e governance artifacts complete; 5c and 5d runtime blocked by platform (session-based tooling, no multi-agent orchestrator) |

## How It Works

### Agentic Pipeline (5-Phase Parallel Workflow)

The platform uses a 6-agent prompt-chained pipeline implementing Anthropic's orchestration patterns. The Code Manager dispatches **parallel Coder agents** — each running in an isolated git worktree with its own context window — enabling concurrent work on multiple issues per session.

| Agent | Pattern | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Project Manager** | Orchestrator-Workers | Portfolio-level orchestrator (opt-in): multiplexes Code Managers, cross-batch coordination |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Routing | Session entry, pre-flight checks (including branch protection detection), issue triage, routing |
| **Code Manager** | Orchestrator-Workers | Intent validation, panel selection, parallel dispatch, review coordination, merge |
| **Coder** | Worker | Implementation, test coverage, structured output (runs in isolated worktree) |
| **IaC Engineer** | Worker | Infrastructure execution: Bicep/Terraform, security-first defaults (runs in isolated worktree) |
| **Tester** | Evaluator-Optimizer | Independent evaluation, test verification, structured feedback |

```mermaid

    P1 -->|ASSIGN batch| P2[Phase 2: Parallel Planning<br/>Code Manager]
    P2 -->|Plans for all issues| P3[Phase 3: Parallel Dispatch<br/>Code Manager]
    P3 -->|worktree| C1[Coder Agent 1]
    P3 -->|worktree| C2[Coder Agent 2]
    P3 -->|worktree| CN[Coder Agent N]

    P4 -->|FEEDBACK| P3
    P5 -->|More issues| P1
    P5 -->|Session cap or context pressure| STOP[Shutdown Protocol]
```

Inter-agent communication uses typed messages (`ASSIGN`, `STATUS`, `RESULT`, `FEEDBACK`, `ESCALATE`, `APPROVE`, `BLOCK`, `CANCEL`, `WATCH`) per the [Agent Protocol](governance/prompts/agent-protocol.md). Up to N Coder agents run concurrently (N = `governance.parallel_coders` from `project.yaml`, default 5; set to -1 for unlimited context-monitored mode).

### Governance Layers (Phase 4a)

    ISSUE[Issue / Design Intent]

    ENGINE --> MANIFEST["Run manifest logged\n(run-manifest.schema.json)\n- Complete audit trail for replay and compliance"]
```

```

## Compliance and Security

Security, regulatory compliance, and code quality are embedded at every governance layer:

| Layer | Compliance Mechanism |
|-------|---------------------|
| Intent | Risk classification at intake; PII/financial flags trigger `fin_pii_high` profile |
| Cognitive | Security-review and data-governance-review panels activated for regulated changes |
| Execution | Policy engine enforces compliance scores, blocks PII exposure, requires security panel |
| Runtime | Drift detection monitors compliance regression; incidents generate remediation DIs |
| Evolution | Backward compatibility checks; breaking changes require migration plans |

For a detailed mapping of governance controls to the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications, see [OWASP LLM Top 10 Coverage Matrix](docs/compliance/owasp-llm-top10-mapping.md).

Policy profiles provide pre-configured compliance postures:
- **`fin_pii_high`** — SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR. Auto-merge disabled. 3-approver override.
- **`infrastructure_critical`** — Production stability. Mandatory architecture and SRE review.
- **`default`** — Standard internal applications. Balanced automation and oversight.
- **`reduced_touchpoint`** — Near-full autonomy. Human approval only for policy overrides, dismissed security-critical findings, or critical risk. Phase 5e.

## Context Management

The framework uses JIT (Just-In-Time) loading to minimize AI context window usage:

| Tier | Content | Budget | Survives Reset |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|
| 0 | Base instructions + project identity | ~400 tokens | Yes (pinned) |
| 1 | Language conventions + active personas | ~2,000 tokens | Session duration |
| 2 | Current workflow phase + panel context | ~3,000 tokens | Released per phase |
| 3 | Policies, schemas, docs | 0 tokens | Queried on-demand |

**Parallel dispatch model:** Coder agents spawned via `Task` tool with `isolation: "worktree"` get their own context windows — they don't consume the main session's context. This allows the Code Manager to dispatch up to N concurrent workers while staying within budget. When N = -1 (unlimited), the pipeline processes all actionable issues and relies solely on context pressure for session termination.

**Hard stop at 80% context capacity.** When approaching this limit:

1. Stop all work immediately — do not start new tasks
2. Clean git state (commit, stash, or abort in-progress merges)
3. Write a checkpoint to `.governance/checkpoints/` with current task, completed work, remaining work, and git state
4. Report to user and request `/clear`

Checkpoints enable session continuity — the next `/startup` auto-restores from the latest checkpoint, re-validates issue state, and resumes the pipeline.

See `docs/architecture/context-management.md` for the full strategy including checkpoint-based reset protection and instruction decomposition.

## Repo Rename Recommendation

This repository is currently named `ai-submodule`. Given its evolution into the Dark Factory Governance platform, a more descriptive name is recommended:

| Candidate | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **`dark-factory`** | Aligns with the governance model name and Phase 5 goal |
| **`ai-governance`** | Descriptive of current function |
| **`forge`** | Short, evocative of autonomous manufacturing |

The rename should be coordinated across all consuming repositories that reference the submodule URL.

### Review Prompts & Agentic Personas

> **Note:** As of Issue #220, individual persona and panel files have been consolidated into
> self-contained review prompts in `governance/prompts/reviews/`. The deprecated files were
> removed in Issue #257. See `docs/research/README.md` for the research supporting this decision.

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Consolidated Review Prompts](governance/prompts/reviews/) | 21 self-contained review prompts (canonical location) |
| [Shared Perspectives](governance/prompts/shared-perspectives.md) | Canonical definitions for cross-cutting perspectives |
| [Project Manager](governance/personas/agentic/project-manager.md) | Portfolio orchestrator (opt-in) — multiplexed Code Managers, cross-batch coordination |
| [DevOps Engineer](governance/personas/agentic/devops-engineer.md) | Routing agent — session lifecycle, pre-flight, issue triage |
| [Code Manager](governance/personas/agentic/code-manager.md) | Orchestrator agent — intent validation, panel selection, review coordination, merge |
| [Coder](governance/personas/agentic/coder.md) | Worker agent — implementation, tests, structured output |
| [IaC Engineer](governance/personas/agentic/iac-engineer.md) | Worker agent — infrastructure execution, Bicep/Terraform, security-first defaults |
| [Tester](governance/personas/agentic/tester.md) | Evaluator agent — independent evaluation, test coverage gate, feedback |

## Why a Git Submodule?

| Approach | Drawback |
|----------|----------|
| Copy-paste | Drifts immediately. No propagation across repos. |
| Package manager | Runtime dependency for static text. Overkill. |
| Monorepo | Forces all projects into one repo. |
| Template repo | One-time only. Updates don't flow. |
| Git subtree | Merges history into host repo. Hard to update cleanly. |

Submodules provide version-pinned, single-source-of-truth distribution with no toolchain requirement.

## Usage

### Adding to a Project

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:SET-Apps/ai-submodule.git .ai
git commit -m "Add .ai submodule"
```

### Bootstrap (after adding submodule)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
bash .ai/bin/init.sh                    # First-time setup
bash .ai/bin/init.sh --refresh          # After submodule update (skips freshness check)
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .ai\bin\init.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .ai\bin\init.ps1 -Refresh
```

The bootstrap script creates symlinks so Claude Code and GitHub Copilot receive shared instructions. On Windows, if symlinks are unavailable (requires Developer Mode or admin), it falls back to file copies.

**Windows prerequisites:**
- **Python 3.12+** — required for the governance policy engine. Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it's in your PATH.
- After installing Python: `pip install jsonschema pyyaml`

### Cloning with Submodule

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <PROJECT_URL>
```

### Updating

```bash
git submodule update --remote .ai
bash .ai/bin/init.sh --refresh          # Re-apply structural setup (new symlinks, workflows, dirs)
git add .ai
git commit -m "Update .ai submodule"
```

The `--refresh` flag re-runs all structural setup (symlinks, workflows, directories, CODEOWNERS, repo settings) while skipping the submodule freshness check. The agentic startup loop runs this automatically after every submodule state check.

### Pinning a Version

```bash
cd .ai
git checkout v2.0.0
cd ..
git add .ai
git commit -m "Pin .ai submodule to v2.0.0"
```

### Project-Specific Configuration

> **Agentic mode:** The Code Manager auto-detects your repository's languages, frameworks, and infrastructure, and creates or updates `project.yaml` automatically. Manual setup is only needed if you want to customize before the first agentic session.

1. Copy a language template: `cp .ai/governance/templates/python/project.yaml project.yaml`
2. Customize personas, panels, and conventions
3. Set the governance policy profile:
   ```yaml
   governance:
     policy_profile: default
   ```

### Cost of Adoption

The governance platform runs on GitHub Actions (Linux runners) and incurs minimal infrastructure cost. A medium-volume team (~50 PRs/month) uses approximately 325 CI minutes/month (~$2.60). LLM token costs for AI-assisted reviews are separate and model-dependent. See [Infrastructure Costs](docs/operations/infrastructure-costs.md) for full estimates and [Token Costs](docs/operations/token-costs.md) for LLM pricing.

### Removing

```bash
git submodule deinit -f .ai
git rm -f .ai
rm -rf .git/modules/.ai
git commit -m "Remove .ai submodule"
```
