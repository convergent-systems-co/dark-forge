# AI Instructions

<!-- ANCHOR: Base instructions — must survive context resets -->

## Core Principles

- Be concise and direct
- Show, don't tell — prefer code over explanations
- Follow project conventions (see `project.yaml`)
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Prefer iterative changes over large rewrites
- Check `.ai/project.yaml` for project configuration

## Context Capacity Protocol

**Hard stop at 80% context capacity. No exceptions.**

When approaching 80% of context window:
1. Stop current work immediately — do not start new tasks
2. Ensure git working tree is clean (commit, stash, or abort in-progress merges)
3. Write a checkpoint to `.checkpoints/` with: current task, completed work, remaining work, git branch state
4. Summarize the checkpoint to the user
5. Request a context reset (`/clear`)

Never allow context to reach compaction with uncommitted changes, merge conflicts, or untracked state. A dirty compaction loses instructions and context that cannot be recovered.
