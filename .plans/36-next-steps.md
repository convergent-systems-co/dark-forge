## 1. Objective

Ensure the repository's goals are clearly documented in the README and create a Developer Quick Guide (TLDR markdown) for developers who want to quickly understand and adopt the governance platform.

## 2. Rationale

The README currently has a "Governance Maturity Model" table that shows phase status, but no dedicated section explaining the overarching goals of the platform. GOALS.md exists but contains stale entries (issues #38 and #40 listed as actionable despite being merged). Developers new to the platform need a concise guide that gets them productive without reading the full README.

| Alternative | Considered | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Add goals inline to README only | Yes | Issue explicitly requests a separate TLDR Developer Quick Guide |
| Create a separate GOALS section in README + separate quick guide file | Yes | Selected — satisfies both requirements cleanly |
| Merge quick guide into README | Yes | Would make README even longer; a separate file is more discoverable |

## 3. Scope

### Files to Create

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` | TLDR Developer Quick Guide — concise onboarding for developers |

### Files to Modify

| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `README.md` | Add a clear "Goals" section near the top; add link to Developer Quick Guide |
| `GOALS.md` | Clean up stale "Open Work" section — remove completed issues #38 and #40 from actionable, update #36 status |

### Files to Delete

None.

## 4. Approach

1. Add a "Goals" section to README.md after the opening paragraph and before the maturity table, clearly stating what the platform aims to achieve
2. Add a link to the Developer Quick Guide in README.md
3. Clean up GOALS.md — move #38 and #40 from "Actionable" to "Completed", update #36 from "Blocked" to reflect current status
4. Create DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with concise sections: What Is This, Quick Start, Key Concepts, Common Operations, and links to deeper docs
5. Commit each logical change separately

## 5. Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Coverage | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Manual review | All modified files | Verify links resolve, tables render, content is accurate |

No automated tests — this is a documentation-only change in a config-only repo.

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Stale information in quick guide | Low | Medium | Cross-reference all claims against actual repo structure |
| Over-verbose quick guide defeats TLDR purpose | Medium | Low | Target < 150 lines; ruthlessly cut details |

## 7. Dependencies

- None (all input is already in the repo)

## 8. Backward Compatibility

Documentation-only change. No breaking changes. All existing links remain valid.

## 9. Governance

| Panel | Required | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Documentation Review | Yes | Core change is documentation |
| Code Review | No | No code changes |
| Security Review | No | No code or config changes |

**Policy Profile:** default
**Expected Risk Level:** negligible

## 10. Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-21 | Name the file DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md | "Developer Quick Guide" per issue, DEVELOPER_GUIDE is conventional and discoverable |
| 2026-02-21 | Keep GOALS.md separate from README | GOALS.md serves as a living tracker; README goals section is a summary |
