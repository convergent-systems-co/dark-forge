## 1. Objective

Define policy rules for ordering concurrent agent PRs to prevent merge conflicts and maintain governance consistency in multi-agent scenarios. Second Phase 5d governance artifact.

## 2. Rationale

When multiple agents work in parallel, PR merge order affects conflict likelihood and governance validity. A sequencing policy provides deterministic ordering rules.

| Alternative | Considered | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| FIFO only (first-created, first-merged) | Yes | Ignores priority — P0 security fixes should merge before P3 enhancements |
| Manual ordering | Yes | Defeats the purpose of autonomous coordination |

## 3. Scope

### Files to Create

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `governance/policy/merge-sequencing.yaml` | Merge ordering and queue management rules |

### Files to Modify

| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `GOALS.md` | Check off "Merge sequencing policy" |
| `README.md` | Add to policy file listing |

## 4. Approach

1. Create the YAML policy file with sections for ordering rules, dependency awareness, queue management, and governance re-evaluation
2. Update documentation

## 5. Testing Strategy

N/A — config-only repo.

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Policy too rigid for real scenarios | Low | Low | Policy is versioned and can evolve |

## 7. Dependencies

- [x] Conflict detection schema (PR #171)

## 8. Backward Compatibility

Fully backward compatible — new file.

## 9. Governance

**Policy Profile:** default
**Expected Risk Level:** low

## 10. Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-24 | Use priority-based ordering with dependency-aware overrides | Matches existing P0-P4 priority system while respecting file dependencies |
