## Open Work

### Needs Refinement

| Issue | Title | Labels | What's Unclear |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| #41 | Agentic Speedup (parallelization) | `enhancement`, `refine` | Platform constraints for parallel agent execution |
| #42 | Agentic Monitor (always-on orchestrator) | `enhancement`, `refine` | Daemon vs. scheduled vs. event-driven architecture |

## Phase 4b — Remaining Work

The following Phase 4b capabilities are designed but not yet implemented:

- [x] **Drift detection** — Schemas and policy configuration files created (PR #69); runtime implementation pending
- [x] **Auto-remediation loops** — Governance artifacts for autonomous drift remediation (PR #81): remediation action schema, verification schema, and agentic workflow prompt
- [x] **Incident-to-DI generation** — Runtime anomalies automatically create Design Intents (PR #87)

## Phase 5 — Dark Factory (Future)

Architecture is documented in `governance/docs/runtime-feedback-architecture.md`.

### Industry Context

The Phase 5 roadmap is informed by industry maturity models for autonomous software delivery — primarily [Dan Shapiro's 5 Levels of Agentic Coding](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-levels-agentic-coding-dan-shapiro/) and the [Mars Shot MSV-CMM](https://www.mars-shot.dev/) capability maturity model. These frameworks describe a progression from AI-assisted coding (Level 1-2) through autonomous orchestration (Level 3-4) to fully self-evolving systems (Level 5). Dark Factory currently operates at Level 3-4 for governance: autonomous issue-to-merge with policy gates, but without runtime self-evolution or multi-agent coordination. The gap between L3-4 and L5 includes capabilities that require runtime infrastructure beyond what a config-only governance repo can provide.

### Completed Phase 5 Prerequisites

- [x] Runtime feedback loop (anomaly → signal → DI → implementation → deploy) — All governance artifacts implemented: schemas (PR #69), policies (PR #69), templates (PR #89), workflows (PR #83, #89), signal adapters (PR #99)
- [x] Backward compatibility enforcement for governance changes (PR #93)
- [x] Autonomy metrics and weekly reporting dashboard — Metrics schema, health thresholds, and weekly report template (PR #101)

### Sub-Phase Decomposition

| Sub-Phase | Name | Achievable Now? | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------------|-----------|
| 5a | Self-Proving Systems | Partially | Can create test governance schemas, test-generation panel definition, proof-of-correctness policy. Cannot build runtime test execution — requires consuming repo integration. |
| 5b | Self-Evolution | Yes (governance artifacts) | Retrospective aggregation schema, threshold auto-tuning policy, persona effectiveness scoring schema, governance change proposal workflow. All are config/schema artifacts. |
| 5c | Always-On Orchestration | Partially | GitHub Actions scheduled trigger exists (#74). Cross-session state via checkpoints exists. Missing: event-driven webhook trigger, automatic session resumption from checkpoints. Blocked by Claude Code/Copilot being session-based tools. |
| 5d | Multi-Agent Coordination | Blocked | Requires runtime capable of spawning parallel agent sessions. Current AI tools (Claude Code, Copilot) are single-session. Can define conflict detection schemas and merge sequencing policies, but cannot implement parallel execution. |
| 5e | Spec-Driven Interface | Yes (governance artifacts) | Formal spec schema (richer than GitHub issues), acceptance verification workflow, reduced human touchpoint model. All are config artifacts. |

### 5a — Self-Proving Systems (Partially Achievable)

- [ ] Test governance schema — JSON Schema defining test coverage expectations, mutation testing thresholds, and proof-of-correctness criteria per policy profile
- [ ] Test-generation panel definition — Panel that emits test requirements as structured JSON; consuming repos execute tests via their own CI
- [ ] Proof-of-correctness policy — Policy rules that gate merge on formal verification artifacts (type proofs, property tests, contract checks)

### 5b — Self-Evolution (Achievable — Governance Artifacts)

- [x] Retrospective aggregation schema — JSON Schema for collecting panel accuracy, false positive rates, and override frequency across runs (PR #115)
- [x] Threshold auto-tuning policy — Policy that adjusts confidence thresholds based on retrospective data (e.g., lower security threshold after repeated false positives) (PR #118)
- [ ] Persona effectiveness scoring schema — Schema tracking per-persona signal-to-noise ratio, enabling automated persona weight adjustment
- [ ] Governance change proposal workflow — Agentic workflow where the system proposes governance config changes (new thresholds, persona adjustments) for human approval

### 5c — Always-On Orchestration (Partially Achievable)

- [ ] Event-driven webhook trigger — GitHub webhook listener that triggers governance sessions on issue creation, PR events, and deployment status changes
- [ ] Automatic checkpoint resumption — Mechanism to resume agentic sessions from `.checkpoints/` state files after context resets or tool restarts
- [ ] Cross-session state persistence — Schema and storage strategy for maintaining governance context across multiple agentic sessions

> **Blocked by:** Claude Code and GitHub Copilot are session-based tools without persistent daemon capabilities. Scheduled triggers via GitHub Actions (#74) partially address this, but true always-on orchestration requires runtime infrastructure.

### 5d — Multi-Agent Coordination (Blocked)

- [ ] Conflict detection schema — JSON Schema for detecting when multiple agents modify overlapping files or governance state
- [ ] Merge sequencing policy — Policy rules for ordering concurrent agent PRs to avoid conflicts and maintain governance consistency
- [ ] Parallel agent session protocol — Specification for spawning, coordinating, and reconciling multiple concurrent agent sessions

> **Blocked by:** Current AI coding tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) operate as single-session agents. Multi-agent coordination requires a runtime orchestrator capable of spawning parallel sessions, which does not exist in current tooling. Governance schemas can be defined now, but execution is blocked.

### 5e — Spec-Driven Interface (Achievable — Governance Artifacts)

- [ ] Formal spec schema — JSON Schema richer than GitHub issue templates: structured acceptance criteria, dependency declarations, risk pre-classification, and machine-verifiable completion conditions
- [ ] Acceptance verification workflow — Agentic workflow that validates implementation against spec-defined acceptance criteria before triggering review panels
- [ ] Reduced human touchpoint model — Policy profile variant that requires human approval only for policy-override scenarios, with all other decisions fully automated
