| #71 | #72 | Simplify install with single-command setup | Streamlined bootstrap with venv support |
| #73 | #74 | Issue monitor (local scripts + GitHub Actions) | GitHub Actions workflow + local shell/PowerShell scripts for autonomous issue dispatch |
| #81 | #83 | Auto-remediation loops | 2 JSON schemas (remediation action + verification) + agentic workflow prompt for Phase 4b autonomous remediation |
| #87 | #89 | Incident-to-DI generation | Runtime DI schema, template, and 6-step agentic workflow for Phase 4b |
| #92 | #93 | Backward compatibility enforcement | Breaking change schema + 6-step backward compatibility workflow for Phase 5 |

## Open Work

### Needs Refinement

| Issue | Title | Labels | What's Unclear |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| #41 | Agentic Speedup (parallelization) | `enhancement`, `refine` | Platform constraints for parallel agent execution |
| #42 | Agentic Monitor (always-on orchestrator) | `enhancement`, `refine` | Daemon vs. scheduled vs. event-driven architecture |

## Phase 4b — Remaining Work

The following Phase 4b capabilities are designed but not yet implemented:

- [x] **Drift detection** — Schemas and policy configuration files created (PR #69); runtime implementation pending
- [x] **Auto-remediation loops** — Governance artifacts for autonomous drift remediation (PR #81): remediation action schema, verification schema, and agentic workflow prompt
- [x] **Incident-to-DI generation** — Runtime anomalies automatically create Design Intents (PR #87)

## Phase 5 — Dark Factory (Future)

Architecture is documented in `governance/docs/runtime-feedback-architecture.md`. Not yet implemented:

- [ ] Runtime feedback loop (anomaly → signal → DI → implementation → deploy)
- [ ] Self-evolution (governance process improves itself based on outcomes)
- [x] Backward compatibility enforcement for governance changes (PR #92)
- [ ] Autonomy metrics and weekly reporting dashboard
