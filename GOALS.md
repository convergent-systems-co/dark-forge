# Goals and Status — Dark Factory Governance Platform

This document tracks the maturity phases, completed work, and open enhancements for the governance platform. Updated as part of the agent's post-merge retrospective process.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Description | Status | Key Deliverables |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| 3 | Agentic Orchestration | Personas, panels, workflows with human gates | **Implemented** | Governance personas and panels, agentic workflows, Code Manager + Coder personas |
| 4a | Policy-Bound Autonomy | Deterministic merge decisions, structured emissions | **Implemented** | Governance CI workflow, structured emissions, run manifests, policy profiles |
| 4b | Autonomous Remediation | Auto-fix, drift detection, remediation loops | **Partial** | Policy engine runtime built and integrated into CI; drift detection and auto-remediation not yet implemented |
| 5 | Dark Factory | Full automation with runtime feedback and self-evolution | **Architecture defined** | Runtime feedback architecture documented; not yet implemented |

## Completed Work

|-------|----|-------|--------|
| #9 | #28 | Policy engine runtime | Deterministic evaluation engine in Python, integrated into governance CI |
| #10 | #31 | Governance CI workflow | `dark-factory-governance.yml` — detect, evaluate, review |
| #11 | #17 | Instruction decomposition | Composable context units per JIT loading strategy |
| #12 | #18 | Auto-propagation workflow | Submodule update propagation to consuming repos |
| #21 | #24 | AI Expert Review panel | Governance-aware panel triggers |
| #22 | #23 | Fix agentic loop | Full PR monitoring, Copilot review handling, merge lifecycle |

### Agentic Infrastructure

| Issue | PR | Title | Impact |
|-------|----|-------|--------|
| #34 | #37 | Plan tracking best practices | Plan archival to GitHub Releases, retrospective prompt |
| #35 | #39 | Issue templates | Structured feature request and bug report forms |
| #43 | #44 | Context management enforcement | 3-issue cap, mandatory checkpoints, two-tier capacity thresholds |
| #26 | #29 | Branch naming convention | `itsfwcp/{type}/{number}/{name}` standard |
| #32 | #33 | Issue labeling | Governance labels (refine, blocked, P0-P4, chore, refactor, ci) |

### Documentation & Structure

| Issue | PR | Title | Impact |
|-------|----|-------|--------|
| #40 | #45 | README and Goals status update | Comprehensive README rewrite, GOALS.md creation |
| #38 | #46 | Filesystem structure collapse | Consolidated 7 top-level directories under `governance/` |

### Personas and Panels

| Issue | PR | Title | Impact |
|-------|----|-------|--------|
| #5 | #13 | Agile Coach persona | Sprint planning, velocity, retrospective guidance |
| #6 | #15 | FinOps group | FinOps Engineer and FinOps Analyst personas |
| #7 | #16 | MITRE Specialist | Threat modeling panel and MITRE ATT&CK mapping |

## Open Work

### In Progress

| Issue | Title | Labels | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| #36 | Dark Factory Next Steps | `documentation` | Goals review, Developer Quick Guide |

### Needs Refinement

| Issue | Title | Labels | What's Unclear |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| #41 | Agentic Speedup (parallelization) | `enhancement`, `refine` | Platform constraints for parallel agent execution |
| #42 | Agentic Monitor (always-on orchestrator) | `enhancement`, `refine` | Daemon vs. scheduled vs. event-driven architecture |

## Phase 4b — Remaining Work

The following Phase 4b capabilities are designed but not yet implemented:

- [ ] **Drift detection** — Runtime monitoring for compliance regression
- [ ] **Auto-remediation loops** — Automatic fix generation for detected drift
- [ ] **Incident-to-DI generation** — Runtime anomalies automatically create Design Intents

## Phase 5 — Dark Factory (Future)

Architecture is documented in `governance/docs/runtime-feedback-architecture.md`. Not yet implemented:

- [ ] Runtime feedback loop (anomaly → signal → DI → implementation → deploy)
- [ ] Self-evolution (governance process improves itself based on outcomes)
- [ ] Backward compatibility enforcement for governance changes
- [ ] Autonomy metrics and weekly reporting dashboard
